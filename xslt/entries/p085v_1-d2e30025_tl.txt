They mix beaten egg glair with earth with which they make
the first layer of the chappe of pieces, & bells, & all
other pieces, saying that the said glair makes it come out
d neatly, & makes it settle, & seats the
substance. In the noyau for a small work, glair is also
good.

Rosette, to come out neatly, wants the mold
to be a little hot & lead, which was also mixed with the
rosette, similarly for small pieces.
