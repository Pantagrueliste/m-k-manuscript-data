Shadows

 Because blacks make different colors, some a reddish black, others
tend towards blue, and others towards green, choose those which tend
towards yellow to make beautiful shadows in oil, for shadow,
especially that of men, is yellowish. And for this effect use very
strongly ground jet, which you will mix with a little
yellow ochre & lead white. Or else, after
you have ground your lead whitebro and
clean p gathered it with the , grind the jet into it. Thus it will be more
desiccative, & making on its own a yellowish black. A little white
mixed in renders it perfect for men's shadows. Blacks which make a
greenish black are appropriate for women's shadows. Take, then, some
black of , a little sap-green & bistre, &
you will have a perfect shadow for women in distemper.



The powder of orber√©grain is darker than
umber & when you lack umber, the said powder will do,
but it does not have body.
