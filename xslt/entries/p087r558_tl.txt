Sand from Thoulouse

The usual bo good one is the one which is
found in a vineyard near Puy David, but the one
which is most excellent is the one is from Le Touch, near
Sainct Michel & towards Blagnac, in a
vineyard that is quite high up. The latter is thinner,
& a little fatter than the other, & better for small works. It
does not want to be too reheated.
