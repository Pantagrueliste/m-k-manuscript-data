Thing that does not release



One needs to cut it to make it burn in the mold, but cut it
with chisels in one go, in order that the blood does
not fall on the mold & does not create filth, which,
once reheated, is difficult to remove. Next, put your mold in
the oven or similar heat, in order that it quickly dries &
retracts, before making a crust or mold on the
mold.

When you mold small lizards, and you want to uncover the part
first molded, begin to uncover the heads & you will recognize its
place by the pin. Do not attempt to uncover the legs until you
have uncovered the rest of the body, in order that the stripped body, as
it moves, does not remove the legs from their place, where it is
difficult to put them back. When you remove little points which
hold the legs, fix them & press them with something, in order that,
when removing the pin, they are not removed from their place,
or, in the end, you can put them back with some wax.
