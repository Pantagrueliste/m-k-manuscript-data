quantity you like and put it into a bottlesubsequently well stoppered, & leave to wilt in there
in the shade for a day. Then put in it

leave it to rest three or four days; and express the
whole into another vessel & into this very same
substance of wine, put in
seven or eight infusions of new flowers. Next, leave the last
