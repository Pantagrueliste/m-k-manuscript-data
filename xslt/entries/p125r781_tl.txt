From small rolls, you make your gates and vents without danger of
crusting & removing anything from the mold, because the
wax, being taken away, leaves the empty space all made. Make
your vents coming from the head, which is in the bottom, towards the
gate. Make also your gate so that it is toobut
little thick, and make within its course two or three notches, for
this breaks up the fury of the metal and makes it flow with ease,
without bubbling nor making too much smoke, which hinders its run. You
can divide it also in two or three branches thus



when it approaches the molded thing, and always make holes in the
gate.

& from these conduits & abrevouers, you can also
put there small threads of wax, which are joined to the body, in
order that the metal goes more easily from one part to another
& runs quickly everywhere. And from these conduits, you lead your
gates & your vents without spoiling anything.
