For casting in plaster

Melt some wax, & with a large brush, coat the
relief of which you want to have the cavity, as if you wanted to paint
it. And a light crust upon which qu will be formed,
upon which you will cast youplaster, to give it body
and strength. Next, in the wax cavity, you will also cast your
plaster in order to have your relief, & it will come out very
easily, thanks to the wax. This is done more often for large
pieces in high relief than for others.
