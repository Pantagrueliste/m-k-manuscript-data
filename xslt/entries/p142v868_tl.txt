Molds

Make some notches, with these, that enter more in the inside of the
mold than on the outside, for in this way, they have more
strength. Keep from reheating in one go & in a too ardent fire, for
this makes them melt break.

Do not keep them in a humid or
enclosed place if they are not well dry, for they go moldy. So do
dried animals.

@One ought not to reheat molds
twice when the animal can be removed without burning, like a
toad, which can well be molded hollow like all thick animals.
However, it is always good to redden the mold once.
