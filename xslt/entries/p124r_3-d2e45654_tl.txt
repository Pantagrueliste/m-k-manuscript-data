Spiderâ€™s web

It comes undone in water & thusly, cannot be molded in a
noyau, but one casts the spider and then one draws the
drawn threads between the grass that they make in the fields
on some carton with a point. One makes
around an edge of paper, glued to the
carton & one casts with tin, very little
alloyed with lead.
