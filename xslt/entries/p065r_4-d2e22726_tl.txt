Greasy colors

If some part remains shiny and does not seem dry after the layered
colors have penetrated, it means that this part is greasy, & that
the second colors one layers on would not take on the dry layer, unless
you rub this part with soap or breathe on it, because the
humidity will make the colors take.



One cannot layer oil on cut paper & model as in
distemper because the colour would run. Thus, to gild with
or mat, one needs to pounce & then layer the gold
color with the pinceau.



All greasy colors, such as ceruse and minium,
massicot, ochre, lead white are good for making
gold color.



Any color or thing that thickens when water is put with it when
it is being ground has body. But those that lack it, such as
cristallin, lake & become clear.
