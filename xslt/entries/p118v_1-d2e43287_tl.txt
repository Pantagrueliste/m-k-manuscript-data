 As I saw that they did not smoke anymore, & that, scratching
the back & the front of the cast & having found that they are
rough & firm & hard on one side and the other, which is a good
sign of their being quite dry, I left them to cool. I took some fine
tinf, one lb, & one ounce
of lead fine & new. I melted it in a crucible until
it was a little like a bit red. Being in this way quite hot
I smoked & not p & being ready to cast & not
before, I smoked with the smoke of a tallow candle all
sides of my frames & imprints & cast & everything.
I set my frame, well joined, in the press. I drew my
crucible from the fire. I left it a bit pass so that
the redness at the bottom of the crucible could die
down. And wanting to cast, I threw in two or three
grains, like pitch rosin, & when & when the
measure of a bean of looking-glass tin & I
mixed, & stirred a little the crucible, and I cast. And the
medal came out as neat as the original. I smoked it with the
candle & cleaned it with small
brushes.


Always cast through the foot of the medal because the head, which is
lower, will come out better, & make the cast longish. And when you
will cast in a large frame several medals, they will come out
better.
