Sand experiments

I have experimented with sand from
Th{oulous}e, & after having reheated it well,
twice, in a skillet, I passed it through a fine sieve,
like the apothecariesâ€™ double, without finely
grinding it further on the porphyry, as I have done
previously. I moistened it with wine boiled with elm
root, and molded with it a large piece of a portrait of
Jesus. I found it easy to release, without having it to knock
on it Jen & molded neatly with one side in
relief, & on the other in cavity, & of the thickness of a
coin of forty sols. I cast very hot

excellent of all, without looking for any other mixtures, because it
receives all metals. It does not want to be used hot, because it
makes things porous. The most finely ground for big works is not the
best, because it does have enough body to withstand
