One ought to take paper from Florence, which is the
finest, & crush it & soak it several times & change the
waterevery day, so that it does not smell bad, &
since you will have moulded it in the cavity, put a
linen over it, & from the back, rub the back of the
paper with a tooth, as if you wanted to burnish it, and
it will mould very neatly. Then glue the cloth on the back
with strong glue.
