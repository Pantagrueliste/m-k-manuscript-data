Lake & lead white & ceruse are easy to
work in oil, but every kind of azure is difficult. And to
make beautiful azure, one needs to layer it not with large
strokes of the pinceau but with small strokes of the
point. Not only ash from Acre &
azur d’Acre but mainly azur d’esmail
which one needs to choose to be very delicate, for it
otherwise you will not v be able to work with it
except with great work, and even then you need to thin it with
turpentine to give it body, and mix it with a little lead
white. Any azure does not want to be ground or washed for it
loses color & becomes wan. But putting it powdered on your
palette, you will thin it little by little either with
walnut oil or turpentine oil,
dipping a knife point in oil, then
tempering it little by little on the said
palette.
