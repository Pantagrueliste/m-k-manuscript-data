Counterfeit jasper

Take horn from which one makes lanterns, quite thin, &
underneath make the figure of your jasper, cornalines,
& other stones, which will be a work more appropriate than on
glass, which is too shiny. And the horn presents a lustre
& a fatty polish like jasper.

You know, as with scrapings of the said horn, the
roses can be imitated. The horn colors for
this jasper wants to have a base with clear turpentine or
spike lavender varnish. And colors matte in body
are not so appropriate here, however beautiful they are.One
needs to oil the unpainted reverse with spike
lavender oil.



Thin glass, for this effect, is very beautiful.



You can encrust beds with it & on the joints you can throw the
filings of talc or of pins on the fresh cement of the said
joints. One needs to join them with gum ammoniac mixed in
vinegar. To better counterfeit marbled jasper, apply
wool of thick hairs dyed in diverse colors & intermingled.
After you have laid down all the colors, scrape oblique lines on them,
then lay down gold &silver leaf. If you lay down on the
horn colors of turpentine, give it a base of silver
or of tin leaf. You can also filehorn & mix
it with strong glue, & lay it down onto the joints of the
piece of horn, then even it with a plane.
