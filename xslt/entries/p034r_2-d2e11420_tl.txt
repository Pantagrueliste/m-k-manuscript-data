XWager someone e that walking
to a certain place and back, he cannot say boot without spurs four times
in a row

XIf he tries to say a it,
but be sure that he speaks loudly, once he has been
there & back, you will tell him that he has lost, because he needed
to say boots four times without saying spurs, for that is your
wager.
