Color of burnished copper

Take one ounce of sal ammoniac with one
ounce of Armenian bole and half of copper
filings with one ounce of sulfur & half a
sestier of vinegar. Beat all into a small oven
of tiles and make a small charcoal fire around it, and put
your pot into the said oven for the whole
day.
