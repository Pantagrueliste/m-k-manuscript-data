Stance of animals

Not only with iron points, but with melted
wax, animals are secured on the slab of earth.
Wash them first in clear water, once dead in the mixture of
vinegar & urine, & with a sponge
cleanse their mouth, eyes and head of the slime which comes out,
for the sand would never set well there and would become
lumpy.


If you want to make them keep their mouths open, put in a little bit of
spinet string, which will not take up space.
