Sand

I tried the bone of oxen feet, very burned &
pulverized & ground on porphyry, until it is
not felt between your fingers. It molds on its
own very neatly. But because on its own it is very arid & lean, it
wants to be well moistened & dampened with wine boiled with
elm root.

Iron dross, well burned bone of oxen feet,
felt also well burned over a closed fire, and all three very well
ground on porphyry mold very neatly in lead,
without needing to be reheated a lot, & casting
lein a hot or cold frame.

Felt alone molds very neatly once moistened & releases
well, and also makes the other two release.


These sands only withstand one casting.


A fat sand which is rendered very smooth, makes it porous.


A fat metal needs lean sand.
