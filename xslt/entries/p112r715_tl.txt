Putting to death the animal for molding

You need to be careful to not wound it in taking it. And having put
it in a glass bottled with
bran, or in a barrelfull half full of
fresh & damp earth, if you want to stock them or keep them a
long time, give them live frogs & not dead ones
to eat. For if you keep them without feeding them, they wither &
grow thin, & have long wrinkled skins. Thus the best would be to
mold it as soon as apres possible
apre after it has been taken. But before, put it to
death it in this way. Place it in a clean bottle or vessel so
that it collects no dust. And put inside such a quantity of good
vinegar & urine that it can be covered. And shake it
& torment it therein until it is dead, which will be in one
hour or a half hour. But if you are in a
hurry


To know if it is quite dead, take it out of the vinegar and take
it by the tail. If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling,
& when piercing it, it would retract & spoil the mold.

Water snakes hardly bite.
