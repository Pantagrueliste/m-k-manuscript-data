Molding a bird

One needs to give it its shape. And to do this, place it on its side
on a clay slab, and hide & sink within it half the
aforesaid bird, in order that it only shows one leg
& one foot, then you will grease it with butter to make it
hold the feathers down, finally ofoileau-de-vie. And then cast. And having made this take, clean &
uncover whatever needs it. Next mold the other side in the same way. But
because the feet, being of bone that is difficult to burn, &
are not able to be cleaned with either by quicksilverIf or by any other means, if the mold would not
open, uncover the bottom of the feet & the toe or the little finger
of the claw, & mold as a separate piece. Reheat & open your
mold & clean the bones. The feet usually remain too
weak to support the mass of a solid bird. And for this reason
one applies an iron thread in the mold of the
feet, which passes into the body before casting, thus they are
reinforced. Some mold the wings in a frame. Others mold the
head &the said wings separately en noyau, then join &
repair them, to first rough out a form that will be rigid &
withstand the wet sand.



They are skinned & filled with cotton cloth. &
even better, one needs to dress them in the way that curriers
do, in order that they do not lose a feather, weight it. The
dressing is alum & paste of flour.
