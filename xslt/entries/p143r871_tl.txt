Molders from Foix

Those who mould de travers make their sand with
crocum & calcined slate, but slate
always retains its asperity & becomes porous, because it is a fat.
In the noyau, it is not good, in sand, it can be accomodated.
They sieve their sand, grind it on porphyry,
and wet it in water, & they take away the finest, which is on
top, then reheat it.
