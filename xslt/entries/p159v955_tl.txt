Plaster alone

Reheated stone plasterfears is undone in
water, but that which is reheated & first
pulverized and then reheated does not fear it. But if it is good it
hardens in it, like the one of Paris &
Spain, which is hard with stone, as is that which
grows in lean & dry earth and which seems like white
salt. Germans make statues for their fountains
with it, which are not spoiled, especially once varnished, but it is
hardened in water. When it is alone & not mixed, it takes
hold more quickly than otherwise. One needs to oil very lightly
your molds that are of metal or stone, otherwise it will
not release. And however you oil, one needs to wet it with hot
water. And when it will have taken hold & is well cooled, one
needs to wet it sometimes in cold water, but if it refuses to
open, in hot water & sometimes in boiling water.



Sometimes one even needs to make the mold boil in hot
water, as when you have molded some wax that you fear would
not be easily released from it.

Cold water makes oil withdraw to the surface of the
plaster that has sucked it in, & thus it released.
