Sand

The sand chosen cast for casting should be neither so
lean that it has no stickiness, nor too fat. And even if it is found
in nature, however, it is not everywhere. And if you
are in a place where it is not found, you can make it, but not with
fat earth, for the sand does not want any of that, for it makes
it very porous. But you can make it bindable with brick well
ground on marble, or plaster or calcinated
alabaster or something similar, or the burned marrow of
ox horn or burned asphalt. If you grind it quite
finely on porphyry, it s acquires
stickiness better & then you can burn it with asphalt or mix
it with a quarter part of tripoli. Guard against
bread falling into your sand because it makes it very
porous.



Try mixing in soot black.
