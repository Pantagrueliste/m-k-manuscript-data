Enamel

Enamel takes more readily on copper than on
silver. It is true that the cut needs to be well hollowed out
& rough. Azure in body & the red called gules, white
enamel & thick green take to it very well. Having
enamelled, one gilds the feuillages of the
engraving. Copper has a similar
hardness for engraving as fine silver or
pistoletgold.
