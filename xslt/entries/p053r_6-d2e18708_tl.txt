Lasting of lead and copper

Lead & tin come out well in white chalk but
the softer it is the better. The one from Champaigne reaches
the price that is fixed in Lyon. Burnt & calcined
horse bones mold very neatly.


I believe that the marrow from the horns of oxen or
sheep, that is to say, the spongy bone from the
inside, molds very neatly and is better than bone.


Note that all brittle metal comes out better than fat ones. Also,
lean sand receives it better & absorbs it rather than the
dense one.
