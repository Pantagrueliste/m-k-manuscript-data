Excellent sand for lead, tin and
copper

D

Since then, I molded with burned bone, iron dross
& burned felt, very pulverised & ground finely on
marble and well mixed together. I moistened them very
well with beaten egg glair. And having covered the medal with it,
as in the others, then filled the frame with sand from the
mine, I knocked moderately. I found it to be of very good
release & molded very neatly. I let it sit all
night long. The next morning, I reheated
it little by little, over the course of seven or eight
hours(for if possible, no humidity ought to
remain in the frame). I cast twice in copper
alloyed with â˜¾, as old
K. The substance
came very beautiful, shiny, & sonorous, & without a
chappe, and my sand was not corrupted at all. Since then, I
have cast with it several casts of soft lead & tin,
that came out better & more neatly than any other that I have ever
found.

When you mold, make certain lines around your mold, in the
frame, in order to attract the substance to all sides, in this
way.

Potin from seringue & other
coworks, runs even better than fine latten.
But I think that it is better halfcopper &
halflatten, which have been used & have been in
very thin works, such as skillets & other similar things. I have
this mixture of half and half come out well.
