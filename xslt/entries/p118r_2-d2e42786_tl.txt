For removing flaws and flashing from things molded en
noyau

If your molds are of good plaster which withstands
well the fire &, they will not crack at all, especially
if, with presses, they are well squeezed well between two
tablets or in a vessel filled with ashes or
sand, & in this way they will make any flaws. But if they do
make some, you can remove them with a burin that one calls
chaple, which has a tip like a small
chisel.
