Oil

Walnut oil extracted likepeeled
almonds is very white. This one of Palma
christi. And when the oil has had a little body, the
colors soften. For if the oil is too clear, the colors run &
do not bind, even those that do not have body. Fatty
oil that is not easily imbibed is appropriate for varnish.
The oil is desiccative enough when it dries out as quickly as
common varnish. Oils do not dry as quickly in cold
countries as in hot countries. Oilexposed to the sun
is clarified well. But it fattens. If you put in ceruse or
lead filings or lead white or calcined pulverized
pglass. To avoid this, put the vial in
clear water.

Colors in oil, once dry, sometimes do not easily receive the
second colors, to prevent this, breathe on them & the color will
take.
