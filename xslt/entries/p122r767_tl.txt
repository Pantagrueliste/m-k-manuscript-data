Arranging various animals

When you discover some lizards, writhing while biting each
other &, which is the most difficult thing to mold,
because of the number of feet & because of the tip of their tails
which are very fine, Il take heed that should
trou some part be uncovered, that remains as if
suspended in mid air, to steady it, in order that the second cast, which
you will do on top for the second half, will not vary. And to steady it
over the void, take a little wax, & rub it & lay it on a
table, shaped like a big needle, then cut that which
you will need, & with the tip of a hot iron wire
join it where it will be necessary. Steady also
frame on the mold all that will
have detached from it (when you uncover the half of the stomach) with
some wax, taken lightly with the point of a pen-knife,
& joined & melted with the iron wire. And when
you will make your cast, one ought only to bring the wax to there &
the edge of the wax joined to the animal, & which, while
melting, will continue the casting up to the animal, without spoiling
anything, which is a secret.

One can arrange snakes bound together in embraces of love,
but that is only when they are small.
