Carcanets made Ã  jour

They are molded like crayfish in noyau, first with
one side being raised up with clay which is hollow, & then
one uncovers them from the other side & one makes the second
casting. They are also able to be cast well in frames, provided
that they are released easily. If they are not, one models them in
wax, or else one fills the cavities that were not able to release
with wax or clay.
