Earth for casting, for founders

It renders itself fat once beaten and also mixed with
horse dung. Potter's earth would be
too fat and would crack & would not hold in the fire, but one needs
to mix it with half the quantity of sand and a quarter
or a fifth of horse dung. And leave
it to dry, then powder it, then sift it to render it fine &
cleansed, which would prevent it from casting neatly. The dung
renders the earth more amenable & easier to deal with, but it
is necessary that it be well free of straw & other things.
And when the earth is very fat, one needs to give it more sand
& more dung. But one does find fat varieties of earth,
themselves mixed with sand. If they are not, make them so artificially.
One always needs to reheat the earths before casting.
