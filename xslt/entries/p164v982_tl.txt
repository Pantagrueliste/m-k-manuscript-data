If there is not enough good alum de plume or
crocum, it will easily break in the fire. But if it is
mixed with it, as it should be, it withstands it. One recognizes it as
good when, being hot after the cast, it quickly imbibes water
when one quenches it in it, & rends breaks
easily because the alum & the crocum render
it spongy. Contrarily, bad sand, which is only of plaster &
brick, & little mixed with alum, breaks easily in the
fire & hardens in water. Cast, if possible, all in one
go.
