First whitening of a panel

One layers two or three times with chalk tempered with
colle de destrempe on the panel, not with a
pinceau but with a broisse in such a
way as if you wanted to pounce, & leave to dry. And reiterate up to
two or three times, then even the last ground layer out well with a
knife, then give coat of glueon top, upon
which you will next be able to make your impression and then paint. But
make sure that your first white is not too thick for it would break
easily. Flemishpainters have such panels
 made by the dozen.
