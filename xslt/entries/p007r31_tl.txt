For coloring stamped trunks

The stamp of sheets of copper or latten is made on
service tree wood engraved
& cut should you want to spend less. And next, the stamped object is
colored with the aforesaid colours of lake, verdet,
azur dâ€™esmail, & soak in turpentine varnish.
But in the place you want to azure, lay down fer
blanc, which is more appropriate for an azure
background.
