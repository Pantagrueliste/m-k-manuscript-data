Scimitars
To know
The workers from Damascus or from
Hungary, neighbors to the Turks, separate, in the
mine, iron from steel. And, from this
first steel, first melted from its mine, they
cast scimitar blades in sand sab blades of the
scimitar, that after, cut the other iron without any difficulty,
because any melted iron is harder than doulx iron
beaten from pigs & bars. Thus is the steel of scimitars, but
it is quite brittle. When one un-hilts b a scimitar,
one recognizes by the tang that enters the hilt that it is cast in
sand.
