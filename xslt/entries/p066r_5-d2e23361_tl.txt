When gold color starts to grip, it is a sign that in ten or twelve
hours it will be dry & appropriate for
gilding.

To make or mat beautiful, put in a little varnish
or fatty oil, not from that which is made from the cleaning of
pinceaulx, but the pure, which is made fatty in
the sun or mixed with ceruse.

Or mat of this sort is scarcely less beautiful than
esburnished gold, and lasts
longer in the rain, & besides, & is made sooner.
Burnished gold is cracked with time & comes apart
in the rain.
