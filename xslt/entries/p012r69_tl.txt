Chimolee

The terre chimolee, otherwise known as
fullerâ€™s earth, with which they dress the
cloth, is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; & if you
want to reheat it, it must first be warmed, & reheat it gently on a
low, indirect fire, & little by little, otherwise it would crack.
Put the figure to reheat in a pot in an oven, or in a
covered oven. It is very malleable, clean & fine. You
can make a cavity for animals of chimolee & cast
lead in it.



The work needs to be dried for 4 or 5 days before you reheat
it. When you mold & make a cavity from chimolee, do
not press too hard, but softly, for it would break.
