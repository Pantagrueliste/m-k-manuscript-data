sieve, and if it is not yet fine enough, wash it, & when
the water will be a little rested, empty the one which is still
troubled in some separate vessel. The big ones will fall down
quickly to the bottom of the first vessel, but the one which
will have come from the troubled water, placed separately, having
taken residence, will be very fine. And then, if it does not have enough
bond, grind it well dry on porphyry, & you will
render it impalpable, & which will have bond just like chalk.
Then, if it seems to need it, you will reheat it, & will crush it
again & mix it with salts, or linen, or burned
felt or ashes of paper & similarly washed things.
