They pay xx lb for a quintal of rosette,
which is harder to melt than latten because it is softer. For,
the softer the great metals# are, the soft harder they are
to melt. The tin used to make bells, which is fine tinis more and which is brittle, is easier to melt than lead,
which is soft. Latten, made brittle by the calamine is
melted more quickly than red copper. The metal, which is the
substance of bells, mixed with tin, and very brittle, is soon
melted. The more silver is alloyed, the sooner it melts, that is
why solder is made with it. In Germany they make very
light candlesticks, it is because they turn them by means of
water, but they are breakable. A quintal of
perfine coppersmith's rosette is
sold for xxx or 40 lb. Another type used by founders
is sold for xii or xv lb. The quintal of metal,
