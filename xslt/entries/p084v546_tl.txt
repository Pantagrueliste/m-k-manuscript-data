Sand for lead, the most excellent of all, for high and low

 I took ceruse and crushed it dry on
porphyry, to make it very fine, then I moistened so
much, with well beaten egg glair, that it was like a paste,
smoothing it perfectly with the dull side of a knife. I left it
a little. 




One ought to mix it well with a knife.
