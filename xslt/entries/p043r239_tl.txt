Purpurine

The soft tin, half an ounce of, melt it in a
spoon. Once melted, throw in an ℥ of ☿, mix
together. Once cold, grind on porphyry. Next take an ℥
of sal ammoniac, an ℥ of sulfur, the yellowest
that may be found, grind both of them. And then mix very well all the
aforementioned materials. Next put all together into a a
pignattaglass sublimatorium, hold this over
a small fire for an hour & for an
hour over a stronger one & for an
hour over a very strong fire, and it will be done.
Next, to use it, apply soot black with the glue that
painters use to paint, & two or three times,
until it is quite black. Next apply a little varnish. Once dry,
apply the purpurine a secco with a finger where
you want. The more you apply, the more beautiful it will be. Next, if
you want, apply varnish on top.
