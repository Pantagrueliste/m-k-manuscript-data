Thick varnish for planks

There is a varnish that takes a long time to dry & still
drips up to two months after it has been applied to the
planks. But this one does not drip like the one used in the
past, which was made of linseed oil boiled with
garlic, to extinguish it & take
out the fattiness, & with wheat. And this one yellowed &
made the blue color of paintings greenish. This one is made like the
other one except that one puts common thick turpentine
