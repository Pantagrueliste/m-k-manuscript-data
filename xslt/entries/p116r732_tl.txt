Molding bouquets, plants and flowers

 One needs to mold them as soon as they are picked because they
 wilt & dry out. Dip them, therefore,
immediately in good eau-de-vie & then put them in your
wet sand mold, like snakes. For which one needs no
release, for while the molds being sreheated, the plant burns, which does not happen with
animals, which have bones & q. It is necessary
that for bouquets, the sand be not as thick as for snakes
because, if it were thick, it would crush the flower.
