Sapphire

One finds sapphires that one calls de
treille, because they are pierced and it is said that a
certain king had made from these a certain ornament in the
shape of a trellis, that would be thus named the
Screen of Charlemagne in the
treasure of Saint Denis, in which the gemstones are
mounted without leaf, so as to have the enjoyment of the light on one
side & the other, &to show their naivete. I have a white one
that seems to be rough & pierced, and is spotted all over with blue
blemishes. I am of the opinion that these are artificial & that they
are of taffre or very clear esmail azur√©
melted entirely on the sapphire. The file bites it
as on the beryl.
