For gilding with gold color and tinsel

Once you have gildedcolored, make your
stamped ornament in tin as said, or
in irondest or copper, one ought not
to put a layer of glue here as on wood, but take only
fatty oil, which is made in seven or eight daysin
the sun with walnut oil and lead white&
with, stirring it often, or cooking it on the fire if one is in
haste. Then, with the oil thus made fatty, grind a little lead
white, massicot & mine de plomb, at discretion, as much of one as of the other.
Minium gives color to the gold. Next, with this, you make
a layer of it evenly on your stamp, taking care not to fill the hollows.
And once it is almost dry, lay the gold leaf on it with
cotton. Such gold will hold up in the rain on
houses & elsewhere. And if you have gilded with tinsel, color
it with fum√©e de perdrix or from yellow or red
cloth, & it will be beautiful like pure gold. You can
cover trunks, mirrors, canopies & posts of beds of colored
velvet or satin and then apply the gilded stamped ornament
on them with strong glue.
