Crocum ferri

It is best made rather with iron rust than with
filings. For if the vinegaris good, you will
see it boil with large bubbles as if it on the rust,
as it it were on the fire, on the fillings, it does not boil
unless it is put on the fire or hot ashes. However, when the
fillings are passed through vinegar & you have made it
evaporate & heat up & it is very red, if you do this again for a
second time, the vinegar will have much more strength, & the
crocum will only be finer for it & redder. Those who
use it to cast in goldven buy the
ounce for forty or fifty sols.



It does not harden the molds, and, in scraping, one cannot tell
that they are harder from it. But it makes the mold less dense,
and it drinks in and attracts the gold better.
