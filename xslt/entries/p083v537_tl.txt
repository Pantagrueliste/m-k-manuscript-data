Bellows

To melt with bellows, & hasten your fonte,
& also cast hotter po, do not place your
bellows at the bottom near the foot of the furnace,
for fear that some charcoal might you enters it, put
them almost under the grille. It is good that your
bellow furnace be in an aerated place so that the
wind might make it heat better, & that it be well dry
& and reheat. One ought to plug the doors of the furnace
& that there is only entry of the tuelle of the
bellows. And by the end, one ought to give it a good stoking,
since at the beginning you will blow gently.
