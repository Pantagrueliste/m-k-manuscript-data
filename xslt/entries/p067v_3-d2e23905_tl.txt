Huiles d'essence

Walnut oil mixed with as much of
turpentine & distilled by an alembic renders an
essence whiter than common water. But this has no body & does
not give a bond for colors that are immediately imbibed, and then leaves
the color without stickiness and faded. These, imbibed in this way,
would not let you work or soften, no more than in distemper. But
you rectify this fault, by giving it a little body with
turpentine, not at all so thick as for varnish. And thus you can
work with azur dâ€™esmail & will make a perfect
lead white. Turpentine varnish made with this oil
is dry in one hour.
