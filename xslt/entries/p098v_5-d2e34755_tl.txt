Earth, or sand, moistened or ground with water, wants
to be reheated more than sand.

Latten from a candlestick is not pure, for one mixes in it
iron filings & potin.

Latten wants to be cast hotter than copper, quod
non credo.

One ought not, to cast carefully, to take metals already
alloyed, but take them pure & mix them.

Iron hardly agrees with being cast in a mixture of
copper or latten.

It is better all with a sand, either in a frame or
noyau at once, rather than several mixed.



One ought to reheat for one or two hourset
p, in thatacharcoal fire which
lights by itself, a crucible with the substance inside, and
then blow & cover the crucible with large charcoals
& the mouth of the furnace with bricks, and
let it consume two or three feedings of charcoal, which
se fill the furnace above the
crucible. In the end feed and stoke the fire, & when the
flame is very white & that the substance will be in a liquid
bain like water & casting off pale blue flames,
cast. The secret is to cast very hot & in one go.
