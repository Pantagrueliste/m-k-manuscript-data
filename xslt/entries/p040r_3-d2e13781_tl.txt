Vinegar

One takes for granted that the mineral salt that looks like
marble & is called Cardona salt in
Catalonia & at the border of Spain, thr
when one heats it red-hot & throws it in the all red or
quite hot into wine, it turns it into very good vinegar.
Some make it with water poured on pomace soured after
being pressed by vintagers, but it does not keep, &
spoils in heat & thunder storms.
