@Glazier

Glass from Lorraine is smoother & more even than
plate glass and it is sturdier & more durable. But commonly
it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which happens
because the glassmakers, having made it, put it when totally
hot on straw, which stains it in this way. However, this
is removed with varnish & salt & other
drugs that the glaziers put in. Glass from
Lorraine is sold by lien & each
lien is composed of three tablets.
The lien costs usually x sous.
Plate glasssold in is made in France, it is
whiter & clearer, but alternately it is not so durable as that from
Lorraine. It is also commonly blown & in that case, it is
better to make little diamonds rather than large square pieces in the
shape of the frame, because they are not able to seat themselves very
evenly.

Plate glass is sold by paniers. Every
panier contains 24 plates that are
commonly sold at x or twelve lb.
