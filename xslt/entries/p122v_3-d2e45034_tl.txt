Molding medals and flat things

You are not bound to making the gate for legs thus



, but rather in this way



, which embraces the medal well. For the other way with legs is only
done to accommodate more delicate works and the other, which is
wide and in one piece, works better for flat medals. But take heed
that all gates be very thin close to the medal & almost not as thick
as the medal, if it is not very thin like paper. And then, from
the medal towards the gate, thicken it as it goes, for it comes better
thus. If the gate is thick, at the entry to the medal, the work will
never come out well. Make that, desp from the middle
of the gate to the top it is moderately thick, & from the same
middle to the bottom very thin. Do not forget to makes grooves at
au hau the top of the gate to prevent that the
metal runs furiously.
