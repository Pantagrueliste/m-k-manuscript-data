For grottos


The old vine stocks

Stones made from water called stuf;
charcoal; the compound of tin & fine latten; paper
pestled & mixed with pestled glass; cork;
heated parchment; white coral are appropriate for making
grottos. But fantastical pieces of wood which are
found in the forests & mushrooms and
potirons of trees, once dry, are better than
any other because they are light. One mixes in small pieces of
looking-glass tin which has a shiny luster. One finely pestles in
a different kind of marcasite which one washes to cleanse them of
earth, &one sprinkles the work with it, which is very
beautiful. If there is no fountain in the grotto, one
glues all al of this with colle
forte, which and it is soon done. Take
specimens of all kinds of mines. The sulfurous marcasites,
which do not have a grain but are even like looking-glass tin,
are very beautiful.

Rosette is found sometimes mixed with certain brittle
lumps which are pulverized under the hammer, which are very
beautiful pulverized on grottos.
