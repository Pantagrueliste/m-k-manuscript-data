however, do not remove it until you have completely repaired the
turtle, for you will use this earth as cement, if
you need to embed something or repair with the small chisel. If
there are some fins at the joints of the mold, you will remove
them, either with the burin, called a
chaple, or a very sharp pen-knife,
or with a small file, & then with the small
chisel, always having the natural thing, to do this better, in
front of you. You can curl on a file the point of a small
chisel, which is not quenched, to make something lumpy. For these
twoturtles & other hollow things, that
presuppose being large enough, cast your alloy of halflead & halffine tin. There is more work in
molding a turtle than for twelve molds of flowers. If
there is some crocum in your sand, there will not be
fins & if, by some chance, there are some on the sides, they will be
thinner than paper, as long as your mold is tightened
well with a press. And to make the scales of turtles
or other animals, you can make some little small chisels, in
the shape of a round cutting-punch, others in the fashion of a
gouge, or the scale of a snake & lizard,
and others on a file to make the curly & lumpy bits. The
turtles, which are not molded hollow, do not have as much work,
for they are molded in two pieces to repair them, with small
chisels, small cutting-punches, small gouges
& small serrated chisels.
