Dragon's blood

Take a well chosen tear of it which shows off its transparent red.
And in a glass bottle put the best eau de
vie you can find, in sufficient quantity. For
it And stop it well and so quickly that it does not evanesce,
otherwise it would be worth nothing. And leave it thus for a
long time, because the longer it stays there, the
more beautiful & better it will be & it will dissolve if it is
good, otherwise it will become like lees. When you want to use
it, make a small hole in the stopper of the bottle & pour a
little & stop it again each time, then apply it on gold.

The good kind of dragon's blood can be found in
large pieces like torteauthis one has no value and is
adulterated & once broken it shows on its edges scales,
transparent as rorouge clair enamel, it is
also lumpy in some parts like small rubies. The eau de

I put it in common eau de vie, mixing in some
aqua fortis to give it strength. At the beginning the

this reason, some coat it with turpentine varnish. Cold delays
the action of the water and the extraction of the color. And for
this reason, you can keep it by the fire.
