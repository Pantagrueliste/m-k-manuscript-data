Excellent sand

Alabaster calcined in a crucible over
charcoal fire, so that, touching it, it turns into powder. Once
cold, pulverise it finely & pass it through a double sieve
& and render it as if impalpable. And d with one
lb of alabaster, one needs one
â„¥ of sal ammoniac. Mix well &
incorporate everything together, then put them in a
cellarcellar or a damp
place. And with this paste, mold what you will need, & next
dry the mold in the fire, & cast whatever you wish, while
the sand is hot; & you will cast as neatly as the main one, &
the sand can still be used by placing it in a damp place
& drying it in the fire.
