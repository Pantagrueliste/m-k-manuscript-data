Chasing

Lead is so fat & soft that one cannot strike it boldly,
& one needs to have a very light hand. The other great
metals are easier. With a burin called
onglet you make & retrace the more delicate lines,
with the ordinary engraving burin the broader ones, and with
the chaple, you remove the big fins, and with the
chisels you soften the harshness of the lines, you smooth, you
add relief to a line.
