Ears

When a defluxion occurs there, one needs
to be very careful not to put anything inside, and according to the
proverb, one ought only to touch the
ear & the eye with the elbow. However, it
is good to put on an affected earmusked cotton, that is
to say, kept in musk, for it comforts quite thoroughly.
