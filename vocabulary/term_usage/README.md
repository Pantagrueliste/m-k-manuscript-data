Frequency counts and term usage lists and tables of tagged terms in BnF Ms. Fr. 640. Lists are generated separately for each tag element (e.g., animal, material) and for the diplomatic french transcription ("tc") and english translation ("tl") of the manuscript .

`Fq = frequency`


Lists are generally of the format:

*(number of times term has been tagged with element) | (term that has been tagged)*
For example:

`210 | Lead`


**NOTE:** counts are sensitive to capitalization, pluralization, and alternate spelling. For example, the following are all counted separately: 

```
Lead
Leads
lead
leads

```
