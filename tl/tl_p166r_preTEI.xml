<head>For the <env>workshop</env></head>

<ab>

If something is omitted: the <pro>harvester</pro> is not reproached for
leaving some ears of <pa>wheat</pa>. If any <pro>artisans</pro> complain
that one discovers their craft secrets, and if the
<corr>goddesses</corr> of <pl>Eleusis</pl> complain, as they did to
<pn>N</pn>. the <pn>Pythagorean</pn>, that one has divulged their
mysteries, excuse yourself based on the words of the ancient
<pl>Hebrews</pl> quoted by <pn>Josephus</pn>.</ab>

<ab>

As the <al>hen</al> carefully searches the garbage thrown out of a
<env>house</env> for a crumb or a grain that she divides among her
<al>chicks</al>, thus one distributes to <pro>orphans</pro> that which
has been researched among the arts considered vile &amp; abject.</ab>

<ab>

Tablet of <pn>Cebes</pn>, idle, but the <env>workshop</env> represents
all things active. </ab>

<ab>

If the jealous disapprove that these things are picked up &amp; taken
from others, reply that since <la>Nullum est jam dictum quod non dictum
aut factum sit prius</la> &amp; that one knows that all arts were
invented <tmp>in the space of a thousand years</tmp>, so that you do not
think that you are able to invent anything new but rather rediscover
anew the books of <pn>Numa</pn>, buried <del>par</del> &amp; long
unknown &amp; forgotten, in order to publish them for those who do not
know them; so that as the <tmp>preceding day</tmp> is teacher for the
<tmp>subsequent day</tmp>, thus you needed to learn from those who
proceeded you in order to teach to those who come after. The
<pl>Latins</pl> took from the <pl>Greeks</pl>, as <pn>Cicero</pn> from
<pn>Plato</pn> &amp; <pn>Virgil</pn> from <pn>Homer</pn>. <pn>Aulus
Gellius</pn> <pn>Valerius Maximus</pn> only revived various
<pro>authors</pro> who had already written. <pn>Livy</pn>, his xxiii
book of the 2 or 3rd of <pn>Polybius</pn>. <pn>Serapis</pn> was deemed
the <pro>inventor</pro> of agriculture among the <pl>Egyptians</pl> ,
&amp; however, so was <pn>Ceres</pn> among the <pl>Sicilians</pl>.
<pn>Pythagoras</pn> &amp; others from <pl>Tyana</pl> learned by their
travels the disciplines which they claimed to have invented in their
country. &amp; will the <pro>weaver</pro> <add><fr>il</fr></add> not be
said to have made his fabric or precious stuff, even though he did not
dye &amp; twist, wind &amp; prepare the bobbins and balls of thread?
Will the <pro>mason</pro> be said not to have made the <env>house</env>,
but just picked up ready-made stones? <la><pn>Apollo</pn> a
<pn>Chirone</pn> <pro>medicari</pro> didicit &amp; tamen deus medicinae
habitus. <pn>Homerus</pn> <pn>Orphei</pn> poema imitatus est, nam cum
<pn>Orpheus</pn> sic prius exorsus esset, 'Iram cane
<del><la>deam</la></del> dea <pn>Cereris</pn> frugiferentis', ita reddit
<pn>Homerus</pn>, 'Iram cane dea <pn>Pelidae</pn> <pn>Achillis</pn>'. In
<pn>Justino martire</pn>, Circa princip.</la></ab>
