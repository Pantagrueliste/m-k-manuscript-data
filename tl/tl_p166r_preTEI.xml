<head>For the workshop</head>

<ab>

If something is omitted: the harvester is not reproached for leaving
some ears of wheat. If any artisans complain that one discovers their
craft secrets, and if the goddesses of Eleusis complain, as they did to
N. the Pythagorean, that one has divulged their mysteries, excuse
yourself based on the words of the ancient Hebrews quoted by
Josephus.</ab>

<ab>

As the hen carefully searches the garbage thrown out of a house for a
crumb or a grain that she divides among her chicks, thus one distributes
to orphans that which has been researched among the arts considered vile
&amp; abject.</ab>

<ab>

Tablet of Cebes, idle, but the workshop represents all things active.

If the jealous disapprove that these things are picked up &amp; taken
from others, reply that since <la>Nullum est jam dictum quod non dictum
aut factum sit prius</la> &amp; that one knows that all arts were
invented in the space of a thousand years, so that you do not think that
you are able to invent anything new but rather rediscover anew the books
of Numa, buried &amp; long unknown &amp; forgotten, in order to publish
them for those who do not know them; so that as the preceding day is
teacher for the subsequent day, thus you needed to learn from those who
proceeded you in order to teach to those who come after. The Latins took
from the Greeks, as Cicero from Plato &amp; Virgil from Homer.
<la><pn>Aulus Gellius</pn></la> <la><pn>Valerius Maximus</pn></la> only
revived various authors who had already written. <la><pn>Livy</pn></la>,
his xxiiii book of the 2 or 3rd of <la><pn>Polybius</pn></la>.
<pn>Serapis</pn> was deemed the inventor of agriculture among the
Egyptians , &amp; however, so was <pn>Ceres</pn> among the Sicilians.
<pn>Pythagoras</pn> &amp; others from <pl>Tyana</pl> learned by their
travels the disciplines which they claimed to have invented in their
country. &amp; will the weaver not be said to have made his fabric or
precious stuff, even though he did not dye &amp; twist, wind &amp;
prepare the bobbins and balls of thread? Will the mason be said not to
have made the house, but just picked up ready-made stones? <la>Apollo a
Chirone medicari didicit &amp; tamen deus medicinae habitus. Homerus
Orphei poema imitatus est, nam cum Orpheus sic prius exorsus esset,
'Iram cane dea Cereris frugiferentis', ita reddit Homerus, 'Iram cane
dea Pelidae Achillis'. In <pn>Justino martire</pn>, Circa
princip.</la></ab>
