<ab>Your <m>lute</m> once dry, put, <ms><tmp>in the early
morning</tmp></ms>, your <tl>crucible</tl> in a <tl><fr>four à
vent</fr></tl>, &amp; at the beginning, give slow fire, as much for
reheating your <tl>crucible</tl> than for gently letting the fury of the
<m>saltpeter</m> pass. Then, invigorate little by little &amp; with
judgment the fire. And <del>y</del> leave in the fire’s full vigor, your
substances, for 12 <ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms>, or a <env><tmp>natural
day</tmp></env>. Make each time a good quantity of this substance, to
not repeat it often, because the <md>fumes, which are dangerous, could
hurt you</md>. And before working at it, take in the
<ms><tmp>morning</tmp></ms> <m>good buttered toast</m>, and hold the
said <m>butter</m>, or <m><pa>zedoary</pa></m>, or <m>gold coins</m>, in
your <bp>mouth</bp>, and <del><fr>ada</fr></del> cover your
<bp>face</bp> with a <tl>cloth</tl> from the <bp>eyes</bp> down. From
this mass, the crust will serve you <del>make run</del> <add>to
clear</add> <del>the great works of</del> the <m>silver</m> <add>from
the <m>metallic</m> mass</add> <del>like <al>snakes</al> &amp; similar
things</del> when it starts to melt. <del>But</del> And then, the grain
that will be at the bottom of the <tl>crucible</tl> should be put aside
for <del>principally delicate flowers and herbs</del> putting a little
in the melted <m>silver</m> when you want to cast it, <del>However is it
necessary to always put a little of this grain in the <m>silver</m> when
<del>you want to cast</del> it is well melted and when you are ready to
cast</del>. Thusly, do as you make fine <m>tin</m> on <m>copper</m>,
&amp; for <m>looking-glass tin</m> on <m>lead</m> and on <m>tin</m>.
And, just as <m>looking-glass tin</m> sours <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m>
too much, if you put it in too great a quantity, likewise, the grain
composed of the above-mentioned substances would sour your silver if
<del>l</del> you were to put in too much, and obscure it. This
above-mentioned composition will suffice you for a long time, when it
has been for a whole day on a <del>gentle</del> gentle fire at the
beginning &amp; invigorated degree by degree until the end. Then, having
given it one load of charcoal, let it consume it by itself, &amp; let
your <tl>crucible</tl> cool. Next, break it. You will find two hard
slabs &amp; <fr>tourtelles</fr> in the <tl>crucible</tl>. The upper one
is like petrified <del>Once</del>, composed of <m>salts</m> sublimated
&amp; mixed together. The lower one is metallic, composed of fillings,
<m>aes ustum</m> &amp; <m>antimony</m>, having the grain very small.
Pulverize the upper <fr>tourtelle</fr>, made from <m>salts</m>, &amp;
put some to clear &amp; clean the <m>silver</m>, and the metallic grain
can be used to put in the melted metal.</ab>

Or, after you have had your <m>drugs</m> pestled by a peasant. And
having put them in your crucible, &amp; the latter luted &amp; dry as
said &amp; placed into the furnace, have the fire managed by a shop boy,
familiar with <m>charcoal</m>. </ab>

One sells well to silversmiths this metallic mass to soften their
solder, because when melting, <m>latten</m> exhales. And with a little
of this substance, they solder over the other solder.</ab>
