<ab>Because <m><pa><fr>millet</fr></pa></m> is naturally very dry,
<pro>harvesters</pro> beat it most often at night in the cool &amp; by
moonlight. Which could not be done with another grain that is wetter,
for one must let the sunbeams pass through, and one scarcely beats it
until the sun is approaching midday. Quickly after the
<m><pa><fr>millet</fr></pa></m> is cut, one needs to plow the earth
because the root eats &amp; thins it as much as if the
<m><pa><fr>millet</fr></pa></m> was still standing. The ground where the
<m><pa><fr>millet</fr></pa></m> will have been sown is quite diminished
of its fertility, which one knows well at the next sowing that one
makes. But above all the <m>grain</m> called
<m><pa><fr>pomole</fr></pa></m> in <pl>Gascony</pl>or
<m><pa><fr>baillard</fr></pa></m> in <pl><sup>northern</sup>
France</pl>, makes, according to the common saying, the earth shake
seven years later. <m><pa>Beans</pa></m> improve &amp; enrich the soil,
as long as one lets the roots and stems rot in it.</ab>

<ab>They commonly have four books. The tiro, which is a formulary for
apprentices, by which they can know how much every item of merchandise
costs and for how much it should be sold. The second is the waste book,
where they put down in rough what they sell daily. The third is the
sales book, where they put down the clean copy and detailed account of
what is contained in the waste book. The fourth is the ledger, which
mentions the sale, the balanced account, the bill and the term of
payment, and this book is accepted as evidence in court.</ab>
