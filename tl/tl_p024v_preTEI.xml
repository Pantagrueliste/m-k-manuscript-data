<head>To bring a canon over <env>land</env></head>

<ab>

It requires a hundred <pro>pioneers</pro> or more to flatten the tracks
by filling ditches amp&; others obstacles, such as <pa>trees</pa>,
<m>stone</m> piles &amp; similar things to make gabions on the way. Once
one is close to the place one wants to batter, the <pro>gunner</pro>
goes at night to locate the most convenient place to mount the battery
&amp; if he does not see well, a false alarm is given so the ones inside
throw torches. Very often, one batters where it is strongest so that the
assailed underestimating the battery do not repair there. Usually, there
are not many garrets amp&; other defenses in that place. And when a
breach is made at the strongest and the cannon replaced, it will
surprise the assailed. One should approach fortified towns at night, but
to poorly fortified towns, <pro>pioneers</pro> bring gabions and once
these are placed, some boards or planks are put behind gabions to keep
the <pro>pioneers</pro> safe, while behind, they fill the gabions with
some <m>earth</m> by means of their shovels. And while this is being
performed, a false alarm is raised from another side. And once you have
shot a volley at the defense, <del>the gabions</del> the
<pro>pioneers</pro> carry the boards to make a plain ground or a
platform of four fingers or half a foot thick. And they are set into the
<m>earth</m>. The platform is five or six feet larger than the cannon's
wheels on each side if there is just one cannon. But if there are more,
the platforms are flush. The space between the pieces is equivalent to
the width of two gabions. As long as the battery lasts,
<pro>gunner</pro>s sleep and eat close to a cannon. In small spaces, one
does not bother to dig trenches to reach the pieces but one puts many
gabions that are high and runs with them. In large places one digs
trenches. There are always in trenches or behind barricades companies on
guard duty to defend the pieces. A small <m>powder</m> container is kept
containing three or four separate kegs</ab>

You have to know the French magazines for the artillery.</ab>

It is good if the platform is slightly inclined toward the front because
the piece is more quickly put in battery &amp; holds better &amp; hits
more vigorously.</ab>

<ab><rub>Fowlers</rub> are those with a lining in the powder container
space. The ball can only roll up to the opening of the chamber. These
ones do not pierce so easily &amp;are annoying to load but they do not
heat up so quickly.</ab></div>

<ab><rub><m>A steel</m> touch-hole</rub>is to be put as an nut in the
canons so it will not be damaged during the shooting unlike the others
very quickly will be. But these nuts are prone to jump off &amp; injure
the canonner. The best is to use a normal touch-hole.</ab></div>

<ab><rub>A touch-hole at</rub>the level of th breach is the best. That
way the cannon hardly recoils.</ab></div>
