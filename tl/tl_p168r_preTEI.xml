<ab>rod that we put into the touch-hole, and then, with a rope wrapped
around the end of a baston, we ignite it and promptly retreat to take
cover. The small mortars of 16 or 17 lb. are attached promptly with a
short, hooked rod made like a wimble, and if it is of a good alloy, we
can ignite it by hand. It is done in this way for mortars of 27 lb., but
then we only put three lb. of powder. The door really needs to be strong
so as not to be blown off for seventeenth lb. mortars. Some people use
little bells worn by oxen or mules as an door for the mortars. Others
load two canons of guns and, with a gimlet and a string, tie them with
the opening against the door. If the mortars are good and do not
explode, they only recoil and cannot harm if one is next to them.</ab>

<ab>A is a small peg, hooked like the pintle of a door and made like a
gimlet on one end for quickly attaching a small petard with ears of
fifteen or xvii lb. for a common door or window.</ab>

<ab>B is a small petard with ears.</ab>

<ab>C is a common petard of 27 or 30 lb. pierced at the breech, through
which a large <m>iron</m> peg passes, button-like on one end &amp; made
like a gimlet at the point for quickly attaching the petard against a
door that will not be covered with <m>iron</m> plates.</ab>

<ab>D These are patens of <m>wax</m>, <m>cork</m> and <m>wood</m> for
loading the petard and sealing the powder well.</ab>

<ab>E <m>iron</m> fork made in the form of pincers as tall as a man, to
promptly set the mortar without a peg. It must be of <fr>doux</fr>
<m>iron</m> in order that the branches bend easily, if need be, to fit
to the height or width of the door.</ab>

<ab>F This is another <m>iron</m> fork of the same height that supports
the fork made like pincers and also sustains the petard, and with its
low claw prevents the pincers from recoiling.</ab>
