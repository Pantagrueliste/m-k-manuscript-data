<ab><m>Fine gold</m> is opposed to it, for <del><ill/></del> on this it
remains yellowish. But alloyed <m>gold</m> is more appropriate to it,
such as that of <cn>escu</cn> &amp; <cn>pistolet</cn>. <del>If</del>
<m>Gold</m> <del><fr>f</fr></del> <del>is not put back on the fire</del>
with its own pale color turns the <m>enamel</m> a dead colour.
<del><fr>Ma></del> And for this occasion, once cut, one puts it back on
the fire to give it a reddish color to make the <m>enamels</m>
beautiful. <add>Otherwise, they are subdued.</add></ab>

<ab>There is <m>rouge clair</m> which, once it is worn down with
<m><fr>arene</fr></m>, loses its beauty.</ab>

<ab>There is some which has <m>grains of gold</m> inside. And it is also
the opinion of good <pro>goldsmiths</pro> that the good one is made with
<m>gold</m>.</ab>

<head>Casting with <m>gold</m></head>

<ab>Molds are recooked better &amp; more surely than otherwise in a
closed fire, such as a <del><tl>pot</tl></del> a <tl>reverberatory
furnace</tl>. So that when goldsmiths want to cast some piece of
important work <del>dâ€™<m>or</m> e</del> that cost a lot to rough out in
wax, they put the <tl>molds</tl> in a <tl>pot</tl> &amp; recover them,
&amp; fill the pot with earth, sustaining the fire that holds them
unified &amp; tight. Then, they recook <tl>mold</tl>, <m>earth</m> &amp;
<tl>pot</tl> together and when everything is quite red, they cast the
<m>gold</m>. Fine <m>gold</m> does not run well, but rather alloyed
<m>gold</m>.</ab>

<ab><m>Gold</m> and <m>silver</m> do not become brittle: once entirely
red and hot, dip them into <m>water</m>.</ab>

<ab>

<margin>left-middle</margin>

<m>Gold</m> is a quarter heavier than <m>lead</m>.</ab>

<ab>

<margin>left-middle</margin>

When <m>gold</m> reaches its perfect heat, it is green like an
<m>emerald</m>.</ab>

<ab>

<margin>left-bottom</margin>

Take care that where you want to cast with <m>gold</m>, there must not
fall any <m>lead</m>, <m>tin</m>, or <m>lime</m> thereof in the
<fr>forge</fr>.</ab>

<head>A way to make the gate for small female <al>lizards</al></head>

<ab>Because you always have to make the gate by the tail, and that it is
so delicate and thin that the <del>casting scarcely</del> metal would
flow with difficulty, especially when the tail is folded, roll
<m>wax</m> in little filaments of this size

and apply some with the hot <m>wire</m>, as said, one at the end of the
tail &amp; others that correspond in the same way, from one
<del>end</del> <add>side</add> of the tail to the other, as you see
depicted. But take heed to do it with the end of the <tl>hot iron</tl>
so that the end of the <m>wax</m> scarcely touches the animal, for the
sand of the second gate will not touch this part. But make the end of
the <m>wax</m> arranges itself only at the end of the empty part of the
first mold. Make as well channels of <m>wax</m> around the legs &amp;,
around the contours of the body, which are a little long &amp; they will
serve as a trough for the molded thing.<cont/></ab>

When the tail, which is delicate and closer to the gate comes out well,
the rest will also come out well.</ab>

The most important is that the ears of the <al>snake</al> come out
well-molded.</ab>

<ab>

<margin>left-bottom</margin>

Your gate must be very thin at the entrance of the animal &amp; of the
thickness of a knife.</ab>
