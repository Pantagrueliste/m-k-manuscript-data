<ab>Formerly, they dipping their springs by immersing them into <m>molten lead</m>. Today they dip their straight springs, &amp; afterwards bend them, which is a beautiful secret.</ab>

<head>Casting <m>lead</m> in <m>lead</m></head>


<ab>There are some who make their cavities with thick <m>lead</m>, then cast <m>lead</m> in them.<lb/>


<m>Lead</m> when not cast hot enough, is white, &amp; blacker when cast well hot.</ab>

One can make a <m>lead</m> mold. &amp; to cast in it, fumigate it with candle soot. But it is never that neat.</ab>

<head>Ways of casting in <m>bronze</m></head>


<ab><m>Latten of <fr> potin</fr></m> <del>cor</del>, which is the most brittle, molds more neatly, according to the opinion of many people, than fine <m>latten of skillets</m>, just like all <m>fine latten</m> molds neater than <m>red copper</m>. If you want to cast something fine &amp; thin, the entire secret is to cast as hot as possible so that the substance boils. You will recognize that it is hot enough when it <m>smoke</m>s a lot and while stirring it throws sparks. To heat well, place your crucible as low as possible &amp; at the very bottom of the forge, so that the <m>bellows</m> <del>fra</del> beat on the middle of the crucible, for in this way it is better than on the grill on which one <add>usually</add> puts the crucible, under which the bellows beat. It is true that the crucible risks more danger breaking, but you can lute it as you know <pro>founders</pro> do.  And also, one ought to maintain <add>the charcoal</add>between the bellows &amp; the crucible. Also take heed to cast all at once &amp; not in increments &amp; drop by drop, which would stop and plug up the conduit of the substance. And if make in the cast an <pro>abreveoir</pro> to <pro>abreuver</pro>  the medal, it would be even better.  And so that the substance heats well at the bottom, stir it, once melted, with a wood stick, for iron only makes it brittle. Turn.</ab>

Some put wool stuffing in order to heat it &amp; make it run.</ab>

Put under your crucible, one large iron <m><fr>platte</fr></m>, which will redden &amp; will maintain the heat under your crucible.</ab>

The <m>copper</m> substance is found to be good for casting, when once broken it makes the grain long &amp; not short, for it demonstrates that it is soft. It is half <m>fine latten</m> &amp; half <m>red copper</m>. This long grain is called long stalk.</ab>
