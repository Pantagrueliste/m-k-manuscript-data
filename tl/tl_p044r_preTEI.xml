<head>The range of an arquebus</head>

<ab>The proportion of a fowling piece is 4 <ms>king's feet</ms> long
&amp; a ball of xviii <cn><fr>deniers</fr></cn>, an chasse of vi
pennyweight of <m>powder</m>, its range iiii-by-xx pans and 3 and a half
feet and two thumbs and a few <ms>lines</ms>, which is the Paris
<ms><fr>aulne</fr></ms>. The medium hackbut, which is the usual one and
the easiest, has xv pennyweight of <m>ball</m>, v pennyweight of
<m>powder</m> &amp; a range of lx paces.</ab>

<ab>They mix viii <ms>lb</ms> <add>or ten</add> of <m>lead</m>, per
<ms>quintal</ms> of <m>tin</m> in <env>cities where they are <pro>sworn
masters</pro></env>. But elsewhere, they add as much as they can. One
also uses ii <ms>lb</ms> of <m>looking glass tin</m> to bind it &amp;
three <ms>lb</ms> of <m>debris</m>, that is to say the <m>copper shards
that <pro>coppersmiths</pro> make</m>. This makes the vessel more
<sn>sonorous</sn> and it is not as breakable.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
This <m>tin</m> is called <m>common tin</m>.</ab>

<head>Arquebuse</head>

<ab>To keep it from pushing back, clean your arquebuse every eight days,
and rub it with <m>oil</m>, and when you shoot, wet some <m>linen
cloth</m> in <m>oil</m> &amp; put it in instead of <m>paper</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Lake</m></head>

<ab>To test it, soak it &amp; apply it to <m>paper</m>, &amp; if one or
two <ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms> later it does not die there, it is fine
and good.</ab>

<head><m>Dyes from flowers</m></head>

<ab>The <m><pa>red poppy</pa></m>, which grows amongst <pa>grains</pa>,
makes a very beautiful columbine on <m>white leather</m>. The
<m><pa>cornflower</pa></m> makes a very beautiful blue. A <m>plant which
grows in hedges, which has a stem similar to <pa>flax</pa>, a long &amp;
broad leaf like small <pa>bugloss</pa>, which has a violet flower
verging on blue &amp; is shaped like the <pa>lily flower</pa></m>, makes
a very beautiful turquin, surpassing azure. Another flower, the
<m><pa>columbine</pa></m>, of the shape &amp; size of the
<m><pa>bugloss</pa> flower</m>, which has a petal like that of the
<m><pa>pansy</pa></m>, also makes a very beautiful turquin. It grows
amongst <pa>grains</pa>, in light soils.</ab>
