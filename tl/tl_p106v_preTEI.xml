<head>Casting in <m>gold</m></head>

<ab>To cast in <m>gold</m>, <del>il f</del> <m><la>crocum ferri</la></m>
is necessary, <add>&amp; more <m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m> than in the
following mixture. The <m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m> mixture cannot
corrupt anything. The <tl>mold</tl> needs to be red &amp; press it
promptly with <tl><m>iron</m> presses</tl>.</add></ab>

<ab>The <m>shell of <al>crabs</al> &amp; <al>crayfish</al></m> are
uneasy to burn &amp; there is a proper way of molding them.</ab>

<ab><al>Rats</al> &amp; <al>birds</al> can be molded, and the feet are
uneasy to extract, when burnt, because they are small &amp; delicate.
The bodies are extracted more easily from the <tl>mold</tl>. The feet
are cast in many <del>foys</del> pieces.</ab>

Those of the houses that are not sandy seem to withstand fire
better</ab>

<ab><m>Tiles</m> with which one covers houses, the hardest &amp; firmest
and recleansed of <m>stones</m> &amp; large <m>gravel</m>, are used to
mix in with the <m>sand</m> for molding. But, before, it is necessary to
heat them just until they have been well red for one or two hours, &amp;
pestle them &amp; pass them finely through a sieve.</ab>

<ab>The little turtles, having just come out of the egg, are very nice
to mold.</ab>

<!--<x>Title: <m>Plaster</m></x>-->

<ab>
<add>If the <m>plaster</m> is mixed with some <m>dust</m> or is not the
hard kind, it bursts in the fire &amp; causes flaws.</add></ab>

<ab>The hardest <m>plaster</m>, as was said, is the best being from
stone, therefore take it raw of this kind. Crush it as finely as
possible and pass it through the finest sieve or sleeve that you can.
Being thusly fine, put it, in a good amount, in a cauldron or skillet
over an open flame, &amp; as it begins to heat up, stir it continuously,
and heavy and lumpy as it is, it will become so light &amp; so
handleable that it will seem to you not to have any resistance to
stirring, as if it was water. Keep stirring it continuously until it
returns once again to being heavy and dense, and that is the sign it is
cooked. But do not reheat it until your brick and <m><fr>alum de
plume</fr></m> are reheated &amp; your clay circles are done. For it
needs to be the last one reheated &amp; when all the rest is ready, for
the less plaster remains reheated, &amp; the quickest it is put to work,
that is the best, for it sets more quickly. One ought not reheat it
until you want to mold. And to reheat it, put it, as finely ground raw
powder, in a cauldron on a clear flame &amp; do not make it too neither
too strong nor too violent. Always stir with a long stick, to avoid the
vapor, turning it around the cauldron &amp; in the middle, in a figure
8. At the beginning, you will find it heavy to stir, because it is full
of moisture. As it heats up, it will start to throw off some bubbles at
the edge of the cauldron. And finally it will become like liquid &amp;
mealy &amp; like bran &amp; boiling in the middle. Continue to stir
continuously until you recognize that it has once again become heavy

<ab><m><fr>Alum de plume</fr></m> is the one that gives good binding to
sand.</ab>

<ab><m>Crocum ferri</m> is appropriate for <m>gold</m>. It is it, once
mixed within the sand, that receives it &amp; holds it within its
warmth.</ab>

<m>Plaster</m>

When you have it as a stone, choose the hardest bits and those which do
not easily crumble away with your nail, and clean it well from powder
&amp; filth before you pestle it.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
<m>Plaster</m> alone does not sustain fire, but breaks up into pieces.

</ab>

<ab>

Reheated <m>plaster</m>, as is said here, keeps well one or two months
well pressed in a dry place, if it's not rainy weather. But when fresh,
it is excellent for for exquisite work.

It must sustain the fire &amp; turn red like a lit charcoal.</ab>
