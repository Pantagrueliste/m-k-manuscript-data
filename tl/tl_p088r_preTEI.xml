<ab>It can be planted, like the <pa>bramble</pa>, on both sides, &amp;
those who plant the large feet against a slope say that it makes a
larger stump. But it only has a point at the top, for it grows
higher.</ab>

<ab>The fine <m>copper</m> mortars do not throw any flames, as long as
the <m>iron</m> pestle is not tempered. If the mortar is indeed made
from <m>metal</m>, when this is sour, in this case one makes the bottom
of large mortars from fine <m>copper</m>.</ab>

<ab><m>Turpentine oil</m> <m>turpentine</m> &amp; <m>good eau de vye</m>
to render it desiccative. Heat it without mixing on the <tl>chafing
dish</tl>, so that it mixes <del><fr>pu</fr></del> by itself when
melting. Next test on a very clean <tl>knife</tl>, &amp; you will know
then if it has enough body &amp; if it does not run too much.</ab>

<ab><m>Dust</m> guards wheat against being worm-eaten. And to clean it
well when it is stained &amp; like rust, pass some <m>ashes</m> through
a sieve &amp; mix them with the <m>wheat</m>, then sift the whole thing
with a bolting cloth made from <m>rough cloth</m> or <m>canvas</m>. The
<m>ashes</m> will pass through &amp; your <m>wheat</m> will stay nicely
yellow &amp; very fine.</ab>
