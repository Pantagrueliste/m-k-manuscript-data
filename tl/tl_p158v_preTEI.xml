<head>Colors for green leaves</head>

<ab>One usually paints them in <m>oil</m>, because <m>distemper</m>
colors have no hold. For <pa>marigold flowers</pa>, <m>lightly ground
minium</m> for some, &amp; for others which are more yellowish, a bit of
<m>massicot</m> with it. For green, the <m>verdigris</m> has depth &amp;
is too dark. If it is a yellowish green, you can mix with the
<m>verdigris</m> a little <m>yellow ochre</m> &amp; <m>stil de grain
yellow</m>. If the green is dark, put with it <m>charcoal of <pa>peach
tree</pa> pits</m>, which makes a <del>v</del> greenish black, in the
same way that black of <m><al>ox</al> foot bone</m> looks bluish. And
thus, by judgement &amp; discretion, put the color on the <m>natural
flower or leaf</m> to see whether it comes close. But layer it
transparently so as not to cover the lines of the work.</ab>

<head>Large molds</head>

<ab>Because of the great weight of the metal, they want to be put in a
press in order that they do not open.</ab>

<head>Candle smoke</head>

<ab>It makes it come out neater, &amp; even if it is a little thick, it
does not hold to any place because it has no body. I have thus fumigated
my <fr>moules de noyau</fr> for tin &amp; lead, and have cast in the
cold mold well dried beforehand, and it came out very neat. It is true
that lead mixed with half of tin was very hot, because the medal was
thick.</ab>

<head>Gate</head>

<ab><del>Even that</del> <add>If</add> the medal is very thick, for this
reason do not give it as thick of a gate. It suffices for the gate to
have half of its thickness. But if it <corr>is</corr> thin, give it a
gate of its thickness. Do not forget to make vents in the gate where
typically the material becomes porous.</ab>

Never forget to oil the gate with wax when you mold plants or flowers,
otherwise it breaks &amp; cannot be taken out.
