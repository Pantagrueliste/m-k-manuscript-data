<head><m>Sal ammoniac</m> and <m>iron dross</m></head>


<ab>I have pulverized <m>sal ammoniac</m>, well dried in the fire &amp; in a hot bronze mortar, and passed it through the double sieve, it became very fine. But to render it even thinner, I have crushed it dry on  <m>porphyry</m>. Then I mixed it with pulverized and finely ground <m>iron dross</m>, in the same way, and both mold very neatly things in low relief, without being moistened in the <fr>serain</fr>, or in the cellar, or otherwise with the napkin, &amp;  it releases very neatly.</ab>

<ab><pro>Molders</pro> from <pl>Foix</pl> who cast their medals from the side, use <m>crocum ferri</m> and <m>calcined</m> <m>slate</m>. It is for very flat things.</ab>

<head>All sands can be rendered good</head>


<ab><pro>Artisans</pro> who work in big works, &amp; who need to further their profit, by seeking things already prepared in nature, because it does not sell its wares to people, and to also save the time they would use for grinding finely &amp; and for artificially preparing sands, seek the one of the mine, which is not too fat, having some earth in it, not too lean &amp; consequently without bond, but rather which is pulled from the depths of the sand-bed in <fr>mattons</fr> &amp; clods that show its natural compactness, which is quite difficult to break &amp; which has a very small and delicate grain, &amp; which is found soft when handling it between your fingers. And because the latter is only found near the rocks in mountainous areas, or lean territories &amp; having <fr>arene</fr>, it cannot be found <de>in</del> in the surroundings of all the <fr>bonnes villes</fr>, where artisans willingly gather themselves.  And thus, if they do not have it close to their house, they prefer to have it come from afar, like from Lyon, Venise, Parys near the Sainct Chappelle &amp; similar places, rather than prepare it. However, you can be certain that in all places you can render the sand from the mine</ab>
