<head>Mortar</head>

<ab>They make them of fine material and fine copper in the shape of
reinforced barrel, and which can hold 50 pounds of powder, and having
made a clean hole in the ground at the foot of a wall, they embed the
said loaded mortar in this hole, with the mouth on top, which will make
a large breach.</ab>

<ab>If you wish to make <m>water</m> rise higher than its source, make a
pipe descend as in A <del>B</del> to B in order to give it push <del>to
the water</del>, then from B to C make the pipe ascend again, which
should not quite attain the height of the source, which is represented
to you by this horizontal line, then make the pipe descend again from C
to D, then raise it again, higher than the line showing the height of
the source. And do this successively until you have reached the desired
height, heeding nonetheless that the length of the descending pipe
should be twice as long as the ascending pipe. This cornet folded back
on itself also shows you a perpetual fountain which you can fit into
some rock, pulling the water with which it is filled by the tip marked
<sup>E</sup>, by sucking &amp; breathing in. You can also make a
watering pipe in this manner, in order that the trussed-up length is as
long as its straight pipe, &amp; nevertheless does not descend as far
down.</ab>
