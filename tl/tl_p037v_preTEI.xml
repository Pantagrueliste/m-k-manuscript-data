For sowing melons well, one needs it to be the end of a moon
<x>cycle</x> for otherwise they would sprout too many leaves &amp; not
bear enough fruit. Make small holes, two fingers by two fingers, with a
pickaxe &amp; put in each two or three seeds. Next, take very fine
<m>earth</m> &amp; fill the depressions lightly with it. Next, spread
over all to the thickness of a thumb <fr>havets</fr>, that is to say
wheat chaff, in order that coming rain does not beat the earth &amp;
prevent their birth. <fr>Havets</fr> attract <al>field mice</al> who eat
the seeds. And for avoiding this, one must moisten them with a decoction
of <m>wormwood</m>.

Some do not lay <m>gris d'escaille</m> on the <m>glass</m> to work on
it, but trace straight on the <m>glass</m> with <m>noir à huile</m>.
However, it is important that the <m>wood</m> be degreased, because if
it has even a little <m>grease</m> <sup>on it</sup>, the color will not
take at all. And even, if the working <pro>glassmaker</pro> has a
<sn>stink</sn> from his <bp>nose</bp> or his <bp>mouth</bp>
<del><fr>la</fr></del>, &amp; he <bp>breathes</bp> on the <m>glass</m>,
the color will not take on it. Those who came up with the invention of
working in small works of softened <m>enamels</m> use only <m>azure
enamel</m>, which is blue, &amp; <m>esmail colombin</m>, which is the
color of purple, which they soften with <m>rocks</m> or <m>lead
glass</m>. As for yellow, they make it from <m>silver</m>, red from
<m>sanguine</m>, as is said elsewhere, black &amp; gray &amp; shadows
from <m>scale black</m>, either strong or weak, carnation from <m>light
sanguine</m>. Green is made first from yellow, then they overlay
<m>azure enamel</m>, either strong or weak, depending on whether they
want to make it bright or dark.

<ab>

It is cut with a <tl>file</tl>, then one passes a certain <m>pulverized
salt</m> across the surface, which an <pl>Englishman</pl> called
<fr>desramonet</fr>. But I believe that this was <m>pulverized pumice
stone</m>, for it had the harshness of <m>arène</m>. And with a taut
<tl>cord</tl>, he polished his <m>amber</m>, then passed <tl><m>tripoli
from <pl>Bretagne</pl></m></tl> on it with the <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>;
others used a piece of <tl><m>leather</m></tl> or a <tl>cane</tl>.
<m>Amber</m> loses its color if an unhealthy person wears it, &amp;
becomes whitish. But to restore it, it needs to be soaked for one
<ms><tmp>night</tmp></ms> in <m>urine</m>, then boiled a little in it.
