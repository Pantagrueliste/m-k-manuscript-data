For sowing <pa>melons</pa> well, one needs it to be the <tmp>end of a
moon <sup>cycle</sup></tmp> for otherwise they would sprout too many
leaves &amp; not bear enough fruit. Make small <del><fr>e</fr></del>
holes, <ms>two <bp>fingers</bp> by two <bp>fingers</bp></ms>, with a
<tl>pickaxe</tl> &amp; put in each two or three <m>seeds</m>. Next, take
<m>very fine earth</m> &amp; fill the depressions lightly with it. Next,
spread over all to the <ms>thickness of a <bp>thumb</bp></ms>
<oc>havets</oc>, that is to say <pa>wheat</pa> <del><fr>fl</fr></del>
chaff, in order that coming rain does not beat the earth &amp; prevent
their birth. <add><oc>Havets</oc> attract <al>field mice</al> who eat
the seeds. And for avoiding this, one must moisten them with
<del><fr>s</fr></del> a <m>decoction of <pa>wormwood</pa></m>.</add>

<ab>

Some do not lay <m>gris d'escaille</m> on the <m>glass</m> to work on
it, but trace straight on the <m>glass</m> with <m>noir à huile</m>.
However, it is important that the <m>wood</m> be degreased, because if
it has even a little <m>grease</m> <sup>on it</sup>, the color will not
take at all. And even, if the working <pro>glassmaker</pro> has a
<sn>stink</sn> from his <bp>nose</bp> or his <bp>mouth</bp>
<del><fr>la</fr></del>, &amp; he <bp>breathes</bp> on the <m>glass</m>,
the color will not take on it. Those who came up with the invention of
working in small works of softened <m>enamels</m> use only <m>azure
enamel</m>, which is blue, &amp; <m>esmail colombin</m>, which is the
color of purple, which they soften with <m>rocks</m> or <m>lead
glass</m>. As for yellow, they make it from <m>silver</m>, red from
<m>sanguine</m>, as is said elsewhere, black &amp; gray &amp; shadows
from <m>scale black</m>, either strong or weak, carnation from <m>light
sanguine</m>. Green is made first from yellow, then they overlay
<m>azure enamel</m>, either strong or weak, depending on whether they
want to make it bright or dark.

<head><m>Yellow Amber</m></head>

<ab>

It is cut with a <tl>file</tl>, then one passes a certain <m>pulverized
salt</m> across the surface, which an <pl>Englishman</pl> called
<fr>desramonet</fr>. But I believe that this was <m>pulverized pumice
stone</m>, for it had the harshness of <m>arène</m>. And with a taut
<tl>cord</tl>, he polished his <m>amber</m>, then passed <tl><m>tripoli
from <pl>Bretagne</pl></m></tl> on it with the <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>;
others used a piece of <tl><m>leather</m></tl> or a <tl>cane</tl>.
<m>Amber</m> loses its color if an unhealthy person wears it, &amp;
becomes whitish. But to restore it, it needs to be soaked for one
<ms><tmp>night</tmp></ms> in <m>urine</m>, then boiled a little in it.
