<ab><m>powder</m>. When the sausage is filled, dip it gently to moisten
the <m>canvas</m> &amp; not the <m>powder</m>, in two <ms>parts</ms>
<m>vinegar</m> &amp; one of <m>eau-de-vie</m>. Next, leave the aforesaid
<m>canvas</m> to dry completely, and then you need to attach to the
sausage a long <m>string</m> or <m>cord</m> <ms>twice as long as the
sausage</ms>, &amp; it is necessary not to tighten it to the sausage but
only to bind it at each end of the sausage &amp; to sew it on the
sausage in a few places in the middle. Next you need to smear all of the
sausage with very good <m>turpentine</m>, and at the one end, at your
will, that you will join to the touch-hole of the <m>petard</m> for
firing, you can sew or tightly attach with a strip of <m>canvas</m> as
large as one <fr><ms>empan</ms></fr> which should also be well soaked in
<m>turpentine</m>, &amp; this strip should be cut in the middle so that
it can be fastened &amp; wrapped around the <m>petard</m>, and it is
necessary attach it so that the tip of the sausage which is open will be
joined to the fuse of the <m>petard</m>. Then it is necessary to put a
lot of tightly-pressed <m>powder</m> onto the touch-hole of the
<m>petard</m>. And next, the person outside of the ditch should draw the
thin <m>string</m> &amp; <m>cord</m> that is joined to the sausage so
that it is extended moderately, but not so much that it is detached. And
if there was <m>water</m> in the ditch, it will be necessary to support
the sausage with a fork. Then, having placed himself &amp; others in
safety, the person who holds the end of the sausage will be able to
fire.</ab>

<ab><m>Petards</m> that one wants to fix on doors or <m>iron</m> gates
are sufficient if they weigh 40 or 50 <ms>lb</ms>. Moreover, for its
load, the ball, &amp; the way to proceed, it is necessary to do all just
as was already said before concerning the one of 3
<fr><ms>quintals</ms></fr>. One man can carry it.</ab>

<ab>The ball needs to be be round on one side &amp; flat on the other
like a <ms>half</ms> of a cut ball. The cross also needs to stick to the
ball - the latter melting if it is made with <m>metal</m> - and wraps
itself with the middle of the cross.</ab>
