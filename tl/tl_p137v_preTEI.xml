<head>Tempering <m>sand</m> for molds of flat medals</head>

<ab>Flat medals, of <m>wax</m> or <m>metal</m>, are oiled very lightly
&amp; then are touched with a <fr>pinceau</fr> of eau-de-vie. And in
order that the mold, wet with water, takes without refusing the oiled
thing, one heats the water well for wetting the sand, for with cold
water it would refuse. Medals are oiled because they are not malleable
&amp; thusly, could break the mold. And animals, which are malleable, do
not want to be oiled. Hot water should be of such heat that you cannot
hold your finger there, without feeling strong heat. Wet your sand
thicker for flat medals &amp; solids than for lizards &amp; fine things.
Your sand, having set, clean &amp; scrape your mold on one side &amp;
the other &amp; make a notch at the foot &amp; the border of the medal
on the side of the gate, in order that you can take it away better.
Lower also the mold, scraping the surround of the medal, in order that,
from all sides, you can take it away without it corrupting the mold.
Next, make your scorings around <del>d’un</del> the first cast mold
<del>mes</del>, in order that the second cast joins with it without
varying, &amp; especially make a notch at the bottom of the mold where
the head of the molded thing is. Make some also at the sides of the
gate. This done, dip the reverse of the first mold in water, oil it,
&amp; thusly it will not be imbibed. Rub the reverse of the medal with
eau-de-vie &amp; secondly cast, wetting in hot water. If you have molded
a medal <fr>en noyau</fr>, having made the first cast &amp; this one
having set, outline, with the point of a knife, the surround of the
medal, in order that it is raised on the cast &amp; and not buried in
it. Then having made the second cast, &amp; having opened your mold,
<del>have</del> take away the medal, in one go, with <del>one</del> two
knife points <del>q</del>, and that one takes it from the side of the
gate &amp; the other from the side of the head, which is opposite.</ab>

Take care not to oil your medal too much, for if the oil seeps out, it
diverts the sand from becoming smooth &amp; amassing &amp; makes it wavy
&amp; lumpy. One should only touch the middle of the medal <del>d’un
p</del> with the point of an oiled <fr>pinceau</fr>, &amp; then spread
the oil everywhere.</ab>

Make especially sure that the gate be the widest you can <del>p</del>
towards the medal &amp; embraces it well, that the entrance of the gate
is ample, always narrowing towards the medal. Do not forget also to
notch the entrance of the gate.</ab>
