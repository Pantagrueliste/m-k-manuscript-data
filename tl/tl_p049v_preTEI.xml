<ab><al>Calandra larks</al> &amp; all <al>birds</al> taken from the nest
&amp; which have not had freedom are better, for these which are taken
by net never sing so well. However, <al>the savage ones</al> give much
pleasure with their chanting, but they ought be taken before Michaelmas,
otherwise they scarcely live. A small impostume occurs on all on the
fork of their tail, occasionally, which some call <fr>gaillardise</fr>,
which makes them sick &amp; sometimes makes them die, especially
<al>calandra larks</al>. One knows when they are sad &amp; do not sing.
One must pierce it, not with a pin, but very gently by turning with the
tip of quite pointy <m>feather</m>. The <al>calandra lark</al> does not
want to be without <m>river sand</m>, &amp; the gray is the best, a
little coarse. It rubs itself &amp; cleanses itself with it.

<head>Grain of <m>lead</m></head>

<ab>Take a <del>pierced</del> <tl>playing card</tl>, pierced with a
<tl>pin</tl> or <tl>needle</tl>, folded on all four sides. Hold it with
the end of a small <tl>split stick</tl> and, holding the said
<tl>stick</tl> by the<del><fr>un bout</fr></del> <add>other</add> end,
put your <tl>card</tl> three or 4 <ms><bp>fingers</bp></ms> away from
the <m>water</m> that you will have put in a <tl>dish</tl> or similar
<tl>vessel</tl>. Then pour your <m>lead</m>, which should not be too
hot, into the <tl>card</tl> &amp; continually tap on the <tl>stick</tl>
that holds it. And thus your <m>lead</m> will turn into round grains.
And pass it through a large <tl>sieve</tl> to separate the largest grain
from the smallest. The larger one will reach 25 to 30 <ms>paces</ms>.

<head><al>Birds</al></head>

<ab>Those that are taken at Michaelmas are good for keeping, but those
that are taken in March die, because they are starting to enter into
love. <al><fr>Bénaris</fr></al> are fed <m>oats</m> all summer in order
that they are fed without fattening, to be more appropriate for hunting
&amp; taking the others. Then, when one wants to fatten them for
selling, one gives them <m>millet</m>. They sing at night. One needs to
take them after mid-July until Michaelmas, for after that time that they
have their young in this country, they go like the <al>turtledoves</al>.
<al>Siskins</al> should also be taken from All Saints' Day until
Christmas, for after they go to the mountains to brood.
