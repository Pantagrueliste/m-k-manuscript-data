<head>For laying down and setting burnished <m>gold</m> and giving red or green or blue</head>
<ab>
<m>Ceruse</m> &amp; <m>lead white</m> is not appropriate for polished white nor for burnishing because it is fatty, but it is quite good for <m>or mat</m> that is made with <m>oil</m> by mixing it with yellow <m>ochre</m> &amp; <m>mine</m> <del>po</del> &amp; by tempering all of it with <m>oil</m>. And this <m>or mat</m> thus applied keeps in the rain like gilded <m>leadwork</m> &amp; similar things. Therefore for burnished <m>gold</m> take good <m>chalk</m>, quite white, well ground, &amp; soaked with <m>distemper glue</m>, &amp; make four coats of it, one after the other, on the <m>wood</m>. And once the last is dry, rub it with <m><pa>prele</pa></m>, which is a plant otherwise called <m><pa>horsetail</pa></m>, to render it well polished. Next take pure <m><pl>Armenian </pl>bole</m> &amp; <m>sanguine</m>, as much of one as of the other, <m><al>lamb </al>tallow</m> as large as a <m>bean</m> or a <m>pea</m> depending on the quantity of <m>bole</m>, and a little of <m>willow charcoal</m> or as much as the <m>tallow</m>, &amp; half a <ms><pa>walnut</pa> shell</ms> full of half-burned <m>saffron</m>. Some put in a little <m>candi sugar</m>. Grind all together with <m>water</m>, &amp; apply it without <m>gum</m> or <m>glue</m>, &amp; let it dry, &amp; rub the place that you want to <m>gild</m> with a piece of white cloth to better make even, &amp; when the rubbed place is a little shiny, it is a sign that the <m>gold</m> will carry itself well. Having rubbed, wash with a clean <tl>brush</tl> soaked in clear <m>water</m> the place that you want to gild &amp; immediately apply the <m>gold</m>, which you will burnish once dry. And if you want to lay in <m>rouge clair</m> &amp; glaze with it <del>de</del>, grind <m><pl>Venice </pl>lake</m> on <m>marble</m> with oil of <m>walnut</m> or <m>linseed</m>. Once ground, mix varnish of <m>turpentine</m> or <m>spike lavender</m> &amp; apply on the <m>gold</m> with the <tl>brush</tl>. <m>Brazilwood</m> &amp; <m>laque ronde</m> die. For green, temper <m>verdigris</m> with <m>oil of <pa>walnut</pa></m> or <m><pa>linseed</pa></m> &amp; grind, next mix in varnish of <m>turpentine</m> and not of <m>aspic</m>, which is not suitable for <m>verdigris</m>. If you want to glaze with <m>azure</m>, it needs to be set on burnished <m>silver</m> and take <m>azure enamel</m>, &amp;, without grinding, temper it with <m>turpentine</m> varnish &amp; apply it.
