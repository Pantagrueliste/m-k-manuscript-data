<ab>since the two <m>bones</m> are joined, <del>co</del>cut them evenly all around, &amp; make notches <del>e</del> around it in different places which cross over the joining of the two bones , in order to recognize well the place of the first joining. Or else, with little shards of <m>wood</m>, pierce them, or <del>ma</del> coat the joinings with some <m>clay</m>, &amp; dry. Press <del>between them</del> your hands joined between your two knees;  &amp; not with a press, because the <m>bones</m> would burst. Mold also at your leisure &amp; two or three times, until you see that it is well pressed tightly together &amp; well imprinted.  And each time before replacing the piece, <fr>ponce</fr> with some <m>willow charcoal</m>, for it makes it release well.  When you have cast, rub the medal with oil &amp; with <m>willow charcoal</m> powder &amp; with a brush, to make it dull.  Guard against your medal being too greasy or oily, when you mold in <m>cuttlefish bone</m>. When you have cast, leave it to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it brings with it some <m>bone</m>. And, cast moderately hot, something you will know when the bone is about to change its <del>good</del> whiteness. But when it is too hot, it really waxes the <m>bone</m > red. The proportion of <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> is as much one as the other. If the piece is difficult to come out, &amp; of several pieces, make the cast forked with three or four grooves, <del>and make</del> &amp; direct these grooves to the place of thickest parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like directly on the head, for this attracts the <m>metal</m> &amp; absorbs the figure best.  Shake your frame a little when you have cast, and thus you will make very neatly several casts. <m>Tin</m> that is too hot burns the <m>bone</m>, which is corrupted. Also, once taken out <del>du mo</del>hot from the mold, it risks breaking.
