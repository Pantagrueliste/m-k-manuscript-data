<ab>or to be safer, go away until the fire will have completely died
down and all will have cooled. For the exalation will be dangerous. And
for that occasion, when you take it with some tongs, wash your mouth
with some good <m>vinegar</m> &amp; take some preservative &amp; cover
yourself well. Once it dies, put it in a cloth or a canvas of
<m>silk</m> &amp; fold it &amp; hang it from the ceiling, where the air
<del><add>or</add></del> &amp; sun will dry it. Once it is quite dry,
pulverize it in a mortar. And keep this powder carefully, because one ℥
of this thrown on iii lb of melted <m>♁</m> reduces it into finer
<m>☉</m> than the other one. But it is of not so much weight. One needs
also for this work to choose the oldest <m>♁</m> that you can, which has
often been melted before &amp; finely hammered into blades or other
works, &amp; at first purify it by melting &amp; throwing it into some
<m>honey</m> &amp; <m>vinegar</m>. The term for the work is nine months
from Saint John until the 25th April. </ab></div>

<ab>Who wants to have it beautiful &amp; <del><fr>p</fr></del> very
delicate, one needs to pick it before the <del><fr>f<ill/>d</fr></del>
seed may be perfectly ripe. For if one waits for the seed to be
perfectly ripe, the foot is so dried by the sun that it is brittle &amp;
breakable. It is true that in this way the seed is reduced by a
third.</ab>

<head>Colors</head>

<ab>If you want to keep them beautiful in <m>gum</m> and such that they
do not lose any of their natural color, put <m>white wine</m>, the
whitest and clearest you can, in a <tl>bottle</tl> with a little
<m>tragacanth gum</m>. And having <tl>stoppered</tl> the
<tl>bottle</tl>, scramble &amp; shake it very strongly together, &amp;
let it rest until the <m>tragacanth</m> is dissolved. Also put in a
little fine-grained <m><fr>sel blanc</fr></m> to brighten the whole.
Some mix <m>clear water</m> with <m>white wine</m>, and with this
mixture they temper the colors without grinding. And these show very
beautifully on <pro>illumination</pro> works.</ab></div>
