<ab><del>If it is for a large work, <m>arsenic</m> &amp; pulverized
<m>tartar</m> &amp; thrown on the melted <m>silver</m>, makes it run
<del>If it is</del> and it suffices. But for fine work, one needs <m>aes
ustum</m>, small filings <del>of latten</del> of copper, <del>du</del>
<m>antimony</m>, <m>sublimate</m>, finely pulverized. <del>This</del>
All of this makes a mass that does sour at all. If the <del>s</del>
<m>plaster</m> is good, one ought not add <m>crocum</m> for
<m>silver</m>, but one puts more <m>alum de plume</m>.@ It needs also
some melted <m>common salt</m>, &amp; some <m>saltpeter</m> with the
aforementioned drugs: <m>arsenic, tartar, aes ustum, copper filings,
antimony</m> &amp;</del></ab>

Flowers can also be kept in their same beauty in distilled
<m>vinegar</m> in a vase, well-sealed so it takes no draft, well-sealed
with <m>wax</m> and <m>mastic</m>. Carnations and roses, the residue of
common <m>vinegar</m> makes them rot. If the <m>sand</m> makes dust, and
sticks to the flowers and hardly comes off with a brush, it is no good.
The most lean is the best.</ab>

<m>River sand</m>, that is washed by the current of water, is good when
strained in a cloth to make the powder compact.</ab>

<ab>This is a rare secret, and which is pleasing for decorating tables,
rooms, studies out of season when winter denies you flowers. Be advised
to pick them when they are in full vigor and still growing, because if
you take them when no longer in bloom or when they are starting to wilt,
they will not keep. Having therefore chosen them, take some <m>sand</m>,
the leanest and driest you can find, that must be very well ground, like
the one <pro>goldsmiths</pro> use to sand <m>enamel</m>, or like the one
<x>used</x> for engraving. But this <m>sand</m> must not be dusty at
all, nor must it stay on your hand or leave a trace when you have ground
or poured it, because it is</ab>

Make sure your box is well sealed so that the <m>sand</m> does not get
out. Keep it uncovered in sunlight and keep it away from the evening
dew, and the moisture of the night, and cover it and keep it in a dry
place.</ab>

You can not put these aforementioned flowers in big vases, because if
you want to take one out, you will take the whole bunch with it. </ab>

Be advised to not pick your flowers when it is rainy or humid, but when
the sun has been shining on them.</ab>
