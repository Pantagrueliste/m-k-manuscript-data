<ab>The parts of a sword are the tang, the tail of the sword, what comes
next is the quillon block, the rest is the blade. The sides are the edge
&amp; the point. Some blades have a sharp ridge, which has one single
elevated ridge in the middle &amp; along the whole length, and are easy
to break. The other blades are called of three edges or three slopes,
which do have a rise in the middle, but it is flat as if it were a sharp
ridge, but flattened, and <del><fr>s</fr></del> these ones are the
safest. The others <del>are</del> are called fluted, which are notched
in the middle, &amp; when it is along the whole length, they are just as
easy to break as those with sharp ridges &amp; are more troublesome to
furbish because the <fr>fust√©e</fr> cannot get in. But one makes one in
particular which is narrow.</ab>

<ab>Of the guard of the sword are the pommel, the branches of the guard
&amp; the <fr>pontet</fr>, which is this <m>iron</m> strip which closes
off the branch which is at the end of the quillon-block to stop thrusts
from sliding into the guard. The rings are these two branches in
half-round which start from the eye of the guard up to the branch of the
<fr>pontet</fr>. The branch that crosses the guard is called the body.
And this <fr>escusson</fr>, by which the sword tail enters and to which
all the branches return &amp; are held, is called the eye of the
guard.</ab>

<ab>Then follows the <m>wood</m> of the grip which one <m>glue</m>s, or
according to the most competent, with <m>gummed wax</m> which is of
<m>wax</m> &amp; <m>pitch</m>, because <m>resin</m> would be too hard.
They heat it lightly, then rub the <m>wood</m> of the grip with it in
order that the tang or the thread take hold there. Otherwise, if a
<m>thread</m> were to come loose, it would all <del><fr>d</fr></del>
break immediately. On <m>iron</m> wire or <m>dog skin</m>, one also puts
<m>glue</m> on it. The garnishment <del>of</del> which is put on the
<m>wood</m> <del>of</del>, which is of <m>silk</m> or <m>thread</m>, is
called the cord, which is made from two <del>thr</del> or three
<m>threads</m> t<del>wisted</del> twined on the spinning wheel, or 4 if
the <m>silk</m> is thin. The slightly bigger cord holds better. The
binding, which is also made of <m>silk</m> at both ends of the handle,
are called the buttons.</ab>

<ab>Some grips are made of <m>silk</m>, <m>dogfish skin</m>, annealed
<m>iron</m> wire, threads of <m>gold</m> &amp; of <m>fine</m> <m>&amp;
false silver</m> &amp; of <m>velvet</m>. <m>Iron</m> wire has a lower
price &amp; is the most durable. Next is the grip of <m>silk</m>, if one
does not have the convenience of being close to the sea to procure some
<m>dogfish skin</m>, which is quite convenient. <del>To</del> The
beautiful <m>skin</m> costs fifty or lx <cn><fr>sous</fr></cn> &amp; 4
or five dozen grips are made from it. This kind gives a good grip even
if the hand is sweating. To work it, if it is too hard, one soaks it for
one or two hours in not quite lukewarm <m>aquafortis</m>, for if it were
too hot, it would cook &amp; spoil the <m>skin</m>. It is sewn with
<m>black thread</m>.</ab>
