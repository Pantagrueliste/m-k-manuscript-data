<head>Varnish of <m>spike lavender oil</m></head>
<ab>One needs to heat <m>lavender spike oil</m> and as it begins to simmer, put in powdered <m>sandarac gum</m> so that it soon melts. And over a <m>charcoal</m> fire stir continuously until the <m>sandarac</m> is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said varnish on a <tl>plate</tl>. And if it is fatty when you handle it with a <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>, it is ready. And for one lb. of <m>lavender spike oil</m>, you will put five ounces of ground <m>sandarac</m>, although some only put in four ounces, but this is not so good nor so fatty. This one is promptly dry. <pro>Framemakers</pro>, to avoid the trouble of polishing their <m>ebony</m>, varnish it with this, as do <pro>guitarmakers</pro>. This is not as appropriate for panels as that of pure <m>turpentine</m>, though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not used to varnish the landscape of a panel when <m>linseed varnish</m> was in use, because it would have yellowed the landscape. But with that of <m>turpentine</m>, one varnishes everything. You can put in powdered <m>mastic</m> extracted in tears or otherwise, and it will be more dessicative in place of <m>sandarac</m>.</ab>
<ab>If you want to varnish on <m>plaster</m> or a wall, first put on your very hot <m>glue de retaille</m>, because if cold it would not penetrate the wall, &amp; when you would put your varnish on, it would come off.</ab>

<m>Varnish of spike lavender oil</m> is not as appropriate for colors as that of <m>turpentine</m>, for <m>spike lavender oil</m> <del>makes them die</del> <add>eats away at</add> the colors since it is too penetrating.</ab>

<head>To remove varnish from an old panel that has yellowed &amp; varnish it anew</head>


<ab>Take <m>white soap</m> &amp; sifted <m>ashes</m>, and soak both in <m>water</m>. And with a <tl>sponge</tl>, take the said <m>ashes</m> &amp; <m>soap</m> &amp; rub the panel with them. And as you see that the old varnish is removed, throw a bucket of <m>water</m> against the panel to clean it. Next put it for a quarter of an hour in the sun to make it dry and to revive the colors. Next, once the panel dries, you can apply your <m>turpentine varnish</m>.</ab>
