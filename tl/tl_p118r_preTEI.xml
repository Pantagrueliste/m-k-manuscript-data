<ab>Those which are found in the <env>sea</env> and similarly those in
which certain small crabs dwell are very beautiful for grottoes, if they
are stripped of the first crust of their shell with <m><la>aqua
fortis</la></m>, for they truly appear to be made of
<m>mother-of-pearl</m>.</ab>

<head>For removing flaws and flashing from things <tl>molded</tl> in a
<tl>core mold</tl></head>

<ab>If your <tl>molds</tl> are made of good <m>plaster</m> which
withstands fire, they will not crack, especially if they are squeezed
well between two tables with <tl>presses</tl> or in a <tl>pot</tl>
filled with <m>ashes</m> or sand, and, therefore, they will not develop
flaws. If they they develop some <sup>flaws</sup>, you can remove them
with a <tl>burin</tl> called <fr><tl>chaple</tl></fr> which has a tip
like a small <tl>chisel</tl>.</ab>

<ab><m>Stones made from water</m> called <m><df>tuf</df></m>;
<m>charcoal</m>; the compound of <m>tin</m> &amp; <m>fine latten</m>;
<m>paper pestled</m> &amp; mixed with <m>pestled glass</m>; <m>cork</m>;
<m>heated parchment</m>; <m>white coral</m> are appropriate for making
<env>grottoes</env>. But <m>fantastical pieces of wood</m> which are
found in the <env>forests</env> &amp; <m><pa>mushrooms</pa></m> and
<m><fr><pa>potirons</pa></fr></m> of trees, once dry, are better than
all because they are light. One mixes in small pieces of
<m>looking-glass tin</m> which has a shiny luster. One finely pestles in
a different kind of <m>marcasite</m> which one washes to cleanse them of
<m>earth</m>, &amp;one dusts the work with it, which is very beautiful.
If there is no fountain in the <env>grotto</env>, one glues all
<del><fr>al</fr></del> of this with <m>colle forte</m>, <del>which</del>
and it is soon done. <add>Take examples of all kinds of <m>mines</m>.
The <m>sulfurous marcasites</m> which do not have a grain but are even
like <m>looking-glass tin</m> are very beautiful.</add></ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
<m><fr>Rosette</fr></m> is found sometimes mixed with certain brittle
lumps which are pulverized under the <tl>hammer</tl>, which are very
beautiful pulverized on <env>grottoes</env>.</ab>
