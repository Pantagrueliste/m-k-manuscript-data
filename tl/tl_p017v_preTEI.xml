<ab>The large canon, which is for great batteries, usually weighs
fifty-five or lx <ms>quintal</ms>s. At the breech it carries the
thickness of <del>b</del> two balls &amp;<del><fr>l</fr></del> a third
of one ball. At the front, it carries <del>ba</del> the thickness of one
ball &amp; two thirds. It is thirteen or fourteen
<fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr>long. But they are very troublesome to drive. The
head-on battery, to accomplish its task quickly <del>is</del> &amp;
batter with great force, is at <del><fr>d</fr></del> one hundred fifty
paces &amp; at two hundred. <del>And</del> It is true that one batters
well from three or 4 hundred <ms>pace</ms>s, but it is necessary to give
it more <m>powder</m>. Its common load is of xx <ms>lb</ms> of
<m>powder</m>, its ball of 40 <ms>lb</ms>. One needs xxv <al>horses</al>
to drag it. When one fires it farther than its usual range, one puts in
a half <ms><tl>ladle</tl></ms> of canon <m>powder</m> more. A cannon can
be fired 4^(xx) or a hundred shots per day, but one needs to refresh it
every time after one has fired <del>te</del> nine or ten shots, if the
battery is steadily used. For if there is a break, it is not necessary
to refresh it as often. For two <ms>quintal</ms>s of <m>copper</m>, or
two <ms>quintal</ms>s &amp; a half if it is for large cannons, one puts
one <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>metal</m>. The <df><m>metal</m></df> is
composed at the beginning of eight <ms>lb</ms> of <m>tin</m> for one
<ms>quintal</ms> of <m><fr>rosette</fr></m>, while for big bells one
only puts six <ms>lb</ms> of fine <m>tin</m> for one <ms>quintal</ms> of
<m><fr>rosette</fr></m>, to give it a bigger voice. For the more
<m>tin</m> there is, the clearer the sound is. <del>Its</del> For gun
founding, if one provides the material &amp; <m>charcoal</m>, as one
usually does, for <pro>master</pro>s do not have the means, one gives x
to xii <cn>lb</cn> per <ms>quintal</ms>. And <del>for the mat</del> when
the <pro>master</pro> provides everything, one gives him 40 <cn>lb</cn>
per <ms>quintal</ms> for large pieces such as cannons, according to the
King's ordinance, and l <cn>lb</cn> for small pieces.
<del><fr>T</fr></del> For the more material there is, the more profit
the <pro>master</pro> has of it. One founds another kind of fowlers of
xxx <ms>quintal</ms>s which are longer than the others, and easily eight
<fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long, &amp; they are for battering defenses &amp;
casemates <del><fr>s</fr></del>, placing them via trenches, at night, on
the edge of the ditch.</ab>

On each side of the breech's opening they give the thickness of half a
ball. And then they also add on each side the third part of a ball.</ab>

<ab><del><fr>Ain</fr></del> one gives it two <ms><tl>ladles</tl></ms> of
cannon <m>powder</m> for its charge, &amp; one &amp; a half of arquebus
<m>powder</m>, &amp; the same for the others.</ab>

The composition of <pl>French</pl> cannons is of one <ms>quintal</ms> of
metal for two of <m><fr>rosette</fr></m>. But those of <pl>Toulouse</pl>
&amp; <pn>Poncet</pn> puts iii of <m><fr>rosette</fr></m> &amp; one of
metal.</ab>

<ab>The <m><fr>rosette</fr></m> for re-melting is more profitable than
cauldrons, which turn entirely into filth.</ab>

Old pieces are composed of almost <del><fr>de dem</fr></del> as much one
as of the other, namely one part of <m><fr>rosette</fr></m> &amp; one of
metal. One recognises this composition with a <tl>burin</tl>. For its
substance is found to be sour &amp; the particle taken from the
<tl>burin</tl> is found to be mixed with yellow &amp; white.</ab>
