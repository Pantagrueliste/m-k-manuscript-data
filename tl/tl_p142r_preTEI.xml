<ab>are not uncovered as much. But because the <al>crayfish</al> is
awkward to burn &amp; clean, one needs to uncover as much as one can,
especially the little legs until the end, for these are awkward &amp; if
they were not to be uncovered and you were to have to pull them, you
could break something in the mold. While uncovering with the point of a
knife, or even a burin or other clean thing, clean very carefully the
sand which will be in the joints &amp; elsewhere with your little
brushes. And if something gets detached, attach it with wax, as said.
And attach also the horns in the same way. And make also the gate, along
the end of the little legs, with some wax. And fill the holes made by
the iron wire point with it. And once everything is well neat &amp; more
than half is uncovered, oil your <del>ut</del>mold <del>&amp;
nâ€™oubli</del>, after having dipped the reverse in water &amp; do not
forget to oil all the delicate parts which are between the legs and the
little pincers. Then, rub the crayfish with eau-de-vie. And make your
second cast, having flattened the first mold, in order that the clamps
join better. Your mold must be wider on the side that is imprinted, than
the back. Do not open your mold after the second cast unless it has been
luted &amp; reheated &amp; that what is inside is burned. Do not forget
to put crocum among your sand when you mold crayfish, for one needs to
reheat strongly &amp; the crocum withstands marvelously. Molding a crab
&amp; a crayfish is all the same. When you have uncovered your crayfish
on one side, delay the least that you can for making the second cast,
for <del>el</del> crayfish dry <del>se</del> out. It is not just about
uncovering the crayfish well, in such a way that you see an entire half,
but take heed that your mold itself, in which you uncover, release well,
for even if the crayfish were well burned, you <del>despoui</del> would
not be able to open your mold without breaking.</ab>

<ab><margin>top</margin>Repair with penknives, <del><ill/></del> files,
little <fr>chaples</fr>, or burins &amp;</ab>

<ab><margin>left-top</margin>make all around them, as you see, a gate of
<m>wax</m> &amp; at the end of the tail, also two or three, whence you
make you make the principal gate.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Make a gate of wax, elongated in a line,
like a large thread, all along the end of the legs, &amp; at
<del>u</del> the extremity of the tail. If there is also some piece of
leg or other part that is further away from the line of the others, or
raised above, or folded on its own, give it a gate of wax, which from
its extremity, joins either at the body or at one of the big legs, or at
some other place which receives a lot of metal.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>Having uncovered it, attach &amp; secure
with wax the two little hairy horns of the crayfish &amp; other things
which are not <corr><del>en</del></corr> <del>despoui</del> secured at
all.</ab>
