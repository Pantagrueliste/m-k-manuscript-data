<head>Arranging various animals</head>

<ab>When you discover some <al>lizards</al>, writhing while biting each
other <del>&amp;</del>, which is the most difficult thing to mold,
because of the number of feet &amp; because of the tip of their tails
which are very fine, <del>Il</del> take heed that should <del>trou</del>
some part be uncovered, that remains as if suspended in mid air, to
steady it, in order that the second cast, which you will do on top for
the second half, will not vary. And to steady it over the void, take a
little <m>wax</m>, &amp; rub it &amp; lay it on a <tl>table</tl>, shaped
like big needle, then cut that which you will need, &amp; with the tip
of a hot <tl><m>iron</m> wire</tl> join it where it will be necessary.
Steady also <del><tl>frame</tl></del> on the mold all that will have
detached from it (when you uncover the half of the stomach) with some
<m>wax</m>, taken lightly with the point of a <tl>pen-knife</tl>, &amp;
joined &amp; melted with the <tl>iron wire</tl>. And when you will make
your cast, one ought only to bring the wax to there &amp; the edge of
the <m>wax</m> joined to the animal, &amp; which, while melting, will
continue the casting up to the animal, without spoiling anything, which
is a secret.</ab>

<ab>One can arrange snakes bound together in embraces of love, but that
is only when they are small.</ab></div>

<head>Flower in the mouth of the <al>snake</al></head>

<ab>If you want to put in the mouth of the <al>snake</al> some flower
<del>q</del> or some branch of a plant which contains the antidote
against its bite, take a little branch, as best arranged as you can
find, &amp; pose its stem into its mouth. Then put <ms>two little pieces
of <m>wax</m></ms> around the stem of the plant. And with the end of a
<del>iron</del> wire, that is hot, melt the wax a little, &amp; with the
other hand, close the jaws of the animal. And then you can cut the head
to make it burn with the flower. If the plant <del>s</del> is strong
enough, it will hold up by itself, and should it be weak like
<pa>wormwood</pa> leaf, which droops, the dampness of the sand will lift
it up, &amp; make it swim &amp; hold up without putting anything there,
although you could pass underneath it some <m>thread</m>, going through
with a <tl>needle</tl>.</ab>
