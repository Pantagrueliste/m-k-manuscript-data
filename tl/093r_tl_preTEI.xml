<ab>The olives go bad if you do not refresh their <m>salt water</m> once a month, do not touch it with your hands, otherwise they will go bad.</ab>

<head>Country folk's observation</head>


<ab>When it freezes on Palm Sunday, it will freeze every month of the year</ab>


<ab>When the first flowers fall because of the frost, the other flowers also start perish.</ab>

<head>Grafts</head>


<ab>Do not use a graft from <m>old wood</m>, because it never makes a beautiful tree.</ab>


<ab>Leave only two shoots on the graft and no more, otherwise it will become weaker. The wind torments it and leaves it strengthless to propagate by cuttings.</ab>


<ab>Trees which have big pith, such as peach trees, and all other trees of their kind, and the plum trees, can't be grafted when freezing because the cold damages their pith, which also has to be protected avoiding to cut the bottom of the graft.</ab>


<ab>All grafts must not be done earlier than the sap flows up, otherwise they dry.</ab>

<ab>The <m>white ash of all woods</m>, which still sticks to the <m>wood</m> that burns, and which has not fallen into the <del><fr>bo</fr></del> <env><tl>hearth</tl></env>, molds very neatly.</ab>

<ab> <del><m>Ashes</m></del> <m>well pulverized tallow</m> molds &amp; releases very neatly. The one from the <env>kitchens</env>, which is fat &amp; shiny, from the <env>big kitchens</env>, is better.</ab>


<ab><m>Finely pulverized quicklime</m> works.  The same for broken up <m>flint</m>,which works better in the cavity.</ab>
