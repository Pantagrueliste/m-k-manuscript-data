<head><al>Silkworms</al></head>

<ab>They are produced from seed, that is to say eggs, that which is sold
by the ounce, which is commonly sold in Languedoc iii lb v s. The one
from Spain that merchants bring there is considered the best because the
worms which come from there are not so subject to illnesses &amp; make
more silk. In Spain, one ounce of seed, they produce there worms which
commonly yield xv lb. of silk. But from one once of seed produced in
France, they only return x or xii. Three ounces of seed are for
producing such a quantity of worms, that with them you will be able to
furnish a room accomodated with three or 4 shelves of large shelves.
Willingly they begin to unskin themselves around holy week. And for
doing this, one puts them in a fir box, like those where one puts
<fr>drag√©e</fr>, warmly among feather cushions. And at the beginning,
they unskin themselves skin like little black ants, &amp; as soon as
there are two or three unskinned, one needs to give them white mulberry
leaves, and then arrange them on the shelves. And three times per day,
one needs to exchange fresh leaves. And if during the day there is some
thunder or rainy weather, cloud-covered &amp; cool, one needs to keep in
the room three or 4 chafing dishes and with glowing charcoal, &amp; put
in incense until all the room would be filled with smoke. And when the
weather is warm &amp;<fr>serain</fr>, the silk abounds more &amp; and
then it is better. Some worms make it whiter, others more yellowish. And
even if it may be white, it yellows when one draws it through hot water.
The worms, from their birth until the time when they make their cocoons
&amp; their prisons, sleep &amp; rest 4 times, &amp; each time remain 4
or five days resting without eating, as if they were dying for rebirth
another time, for each time they change skin &amp; begin by unskinning
the head then consequently, on different days, the rest of the body,
&amp; from white turn grayish, &amp; from grayish to white. And if one
of them has some illness who does not have the strength to unskin, one
needs to help it &amp; prevent puncturing it, for at that time rendering
a yellow liquor, it is no longer worth anything. And further they
scarcely profit after one has handled it with the hand. Around
Pentecost, they begin to want to climb on the dry branches of heath or
heather that one prepares for them &amp; attaches</ab>

See Marco Girolamo Vida, Bishop of Alba and Cremona, wrote a poem on the
nature of silkworms.
