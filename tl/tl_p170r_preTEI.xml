<ab><m>perfume</m> and similar things. But be sure that the <m>black</m>
<m>wax</m>with which you cast is hard, so it will come off rapidly when
dry so you can see if it has been stamped correctly. It can be made
harder by adding more melted <m>sulphur</m> in the melted <m>wax</m>,
and a bit of <m>resin</m>.</ab>

<head>Current medals</head>

<ab>One makes the relief puncheons of untempered <m>steel</m>, then one
tempers them, &amp; with these one strikes on matrices, not reddened in
fire, as some think, but on steeled <m>iron</m>, reheated &amp;
sweetened, which one next tempers.</ab>

<head>Cast</head>

<ab>Do not cast at once for in doing so, the metal is regurgitated
<corr><del>&amp;</del></corr> <del>in</del> &amp; the metal gets cold
before it goes down. But, cast bit by bit &amp; taking your time.</ab>

<ab>When you put them back the second time, make sure that the mold does
not shift.</ab>

<head>Molds</head>

<ab>Those of <fr>noyau</fr>, when being reheated, want to be set on
<m>charcoals</m> a <add>little</add> spent, without the air touching
them, like the frame molds want to be <del>recu</del> dried in the open,
&amp; uncovered.</ab>

<head>Thick works of <m>tin</m></head>

<ab>They do not want to be cast in <m>lead</m> or <m>red tin</m> like
thin &amp; delicate things. It is enough if it is <del>f</del>
well-melted &amp; hot. Thin things want to be quite hot &amp; of <m>red
tin</m>.</ab>

<head>Cleaning closed molds</head>

<ab>One needs to let them cool rather than blow inside to clean them,
for once hot they retain the ash. Once cold, they are cleaned better.
Take a thin wire of <m>latten</m> or a delicate straw to clean the tail
completely, for this is what makes the gate. Blow into it &amp; suck,
drawing it to you. Before molding, enlarge the tail with <m>wax</m>,
then cut it,

&amp; join &amp; solder a tail of <m>latten</m> wire by solder. The
lumps of a flower, it is a little thing, for this can be removed with
the <fr>chaple</fr>, but so that leaves come out well, then the paint
covers everything.</ab>
