<head>Semi-lively colors</head>


<ab>When colors absorb into the <m>canvas</m>, it means that it has been primed only once, &amp; for this reason they become matte without being shiny. But this is the best way, as long as you re-coat it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having more body, do not die &amp; are all the more beautiful for it, especially <m>azure</m> ,<m>lake</m> &amp; those do not have body. But those who want to rush their painting  prime twice on the first go, to be done with it. Thus the colors do not absorb, also they will not last as long. The second layer of these does not absorb &amp; remains shiny.</ab>

<head>Painting large figures</head>
 
<ab>You need to put your <m>charcoal</m> at the tip of a stick such that you make your first drawing from a distance because up close, you would not be able to judge proportions as well as from a certain &amp; sufficient distance. Also, when you paint up close, hold your <m>charcoal</m> at the farthest end, &amp; practically with your fingertips. For in this way you will acquire an artist's touch &amp; give your hand effortless facility.</ab>

<pro>Illuminators</pro> painting on <m>paper</m> temper their colors with <m>gum</m> &amp; mix in a little <m>soap</m> to make them run better.</ab>

<head><m>Glazing</m></head>
 
<ab>One usually glazes with colors which do not have body, such as <m>lake</m> &amp; m>verdigris</m>. However, to use other kinds, one mixes in plenty of calcined &amp; crushed <m>cristallin</m>, which also has no body &amp; lightens their thickness.</ab>

<pro>Painters</pro> must all learn how to draw after nature, for to them it is travel provisions &amp; revenue &amp; sure means of earning their passage when travelling across the lands with only their <m><fr>cocon</fr></m>.

<head>White and black</head>
 
<ab>It is good that an <pro>apprentice</pro> should work with black &amp; white for two or three years to become an <pro>artist</pro>.</ab>

<head>After nature</head>
<ab>There are some who paint after nature on <m>oiled paper</m>, &amp; if they do not finish in one go, they put their <m>paper</m> &amp; unfinished picture in <m>water</m> so that it shall not dry. </ab>

<head>Impression</head>
 
<ab>You must be quite careful about this, and do not do it, as some will, using <m>gold</m> color made by cleaning the <m>oil</m> brushes, because <m>verdigris</m> and other corrosive colors included will end by fading the colors that are laid in after. It is useful to do it with <m>ceruse</m>, <m>yellow ocher</m>, and a bit of <m>massicot</m>, and make it scarcely thick so that it will not crack.</ab>
