<head>For casting in <m>red copper</m></head>

<ab>Pure red copper from a cauldron or other thin works is appropriate
for casting. And to make it run, throw in some sal ammoniac &amp; when
you are ready to cast, put in a little fine tin &amp; very little. And
note that one needs to cast copper very hot in the mold, which needs to
also be inflamed &amp; entirely red like for gold, silver, latten &amp;
metal. You will recognize that it is hot enough when it is smooth, thin
&amp; shiny like a mirror <del>de cu</del> of steel, newly polished, or
like melted silver. Keep it from the wind, for it will quickly cool. Fix
the cast with tows <del>or</del> to keep it from cooling. Red copper
comes out more neatly than latten, which has strong smoke that prevents
it from running. I molded it in <fr>noyau</fr> neatly like the principal
one &amp; thin like paper. It is necessary that it be so hot that it is
white &amp; shiny &amp; polished like melted silver and like a mirror. I
cast it in the same sand as above in <fr>noyau</fr>.</ab>

Copper and latten are the longest to melt, longer than any other metal,
especially red copper. But also it flows &amp; comes out very neat,
provided that it is cast very hot, that it is like water.</ab>

Removing your mold from the fire, plant it in <del>es</del> a brazier,
that fills a pot or a vessel.</ab>

<head><m>Huile tingente</m> to make metals run</head>

<ab>Take some <m><figure>â˜¿</figure></m> sublimate of Venice, true &amp;
not arsenic sublimate, pea size, aes ustum, pea size, sal ammoniac, pea
size. Pulverize everything separately &amp; next mix everything in a
glass bottle &amp; put on hot ash. You will see that everything
dissolves like wax, making many colors. Let it <del>everything</del> set
&amp; put a little of it on each melted metal &amp; it will run
marvelously.</ab>

<pro>Founders</pro>, with large casts for statues, throw in much tartar,
to clean it of its filth &amp; nastiness &amp; much sal ammoniac to
render it thin &amp; neat. And when they want to cast, they put in much
tin. The cold &amp; humidity strongly disagrees with it, which renders
dangerous the work of the founder, for one only needs a spring of water
in the pit to lose everything.</ab>

<head>Clamps</head>

<ab>They are made with flat pincers of iron wire, reheated &amp;
refolded then beaten at the ends, on the anvil. When they are thusly
fine, they are subject to burning, being put often in the molds for
reheating. Therefore use the new ones.</ab>
