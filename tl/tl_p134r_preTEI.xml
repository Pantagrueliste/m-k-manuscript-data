avoid putting points, which should not be put except at the raising of
the head, at the thickest places of the body &amp; the simple &amp;
delicate parts in the middle of the lizard’s feet, the nails of which
you will enter into the slab of clay, in order that they remain secure.
When you have made the first cast &amp; uncovered the belly of the
animal; do not forget to put small thin <del>s</del> slabs of wax at the
end of the lizard’s legs. But, if it is a small wall lizard, lightly
cover with wax the entire bottom of the foot, <del>and</del> and
<del>this</del> the wax, being removed after the second cast, leaves a
cavity which fills these small fingers with metal, &amp; then one
repairs them. Take heed therefore to attach well with wax the parts of
the animal which pass one on top of the other, in order that the wet
sand entering between two does not take it away. <del>And if</del> For,
if this were to happen<del>mold would corrupt</del>, the shape <del>in
the first place</del> would <del>spoil</del> corrupt &amp; your mold
also, because it would not have the thickness that <del>it</del> you
think &amp; would be pierced &amp; spoiled. And, even though to avoid
this you can make the mold thicker, however, should <del>l</del> this
mishap happpen, you will be able to repair it in this way.</ab>

<head>For mending a pierced mold</head>

<ab>

If the molded animal comes away in some place and deviates from the
shape <del>to not have</del> that you gave it, because it was not very
dead, or because it was not well attached with the iron points or with
melted wax, and it does not have the thickness that it needs on the
outside, at the middle of the swelling, or is pierced, before removing
the animal from inside, uncover what seems to you the weakest part, or
else the place that is pierced, and make small holes all around
<corr><del>all around</del></corr>, then soak the back of the mold. And
cast quickly on top of the same wet sand, which will enter in these
openings &amp; mold &amp; attach to the other. But, one will need to
lute this place well, after. </ab>

<head>Sand of <m>crocum</m></head>

<ab>

One can use the mixture of crocum ferri in molds for silver as well as
for gold, for it firms them &amp; keeps them from cracking &amp; making
flaws. And I believe that for flat things it would withstand <del>bien
de</del> several casts, which, however, for gold &amp; silver is hardly
done.</ab>
