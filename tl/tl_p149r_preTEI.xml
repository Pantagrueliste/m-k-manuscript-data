<head>Softening <m>iron</m> and rendering it very soft</head>

<ab>Take <m>sublimate</m>, <m>quicklime</m>, <m>soap from
<pl>Venice</pl></m>, <m>horse dung</m>, a little less <m>sublimate</m>
than the others. Wet all of this together like paste &amp; with this
impaste the <m>iron</m>, &amp; to do this envelope it with some bad

<head>Base gold from <pl>Germany</pl>, <m><fr>electre</fr></m></head>

<ab>One calls it <m>gold</m> from the <pl>Rhine</pl>, which one finds in
the rivers, and is spangle gold. <pro>Goldsmiths</pro> from
<pl>German</pl> wanted to refine it, thinking to separate it from this
whiteness which they deemed to be <m>silver</m>. But it always remains
whiteish, which demonstrates that this whiteness is fixed &amp; it does
not lack color. This is <m><fr>electre</fr></m>, from which one is able
to make cups, which will demonstrate poison.</ab></div>

<m>thread from iron</m>, they redden large masses of <m>iron</m>, &amp;
