<ab>again very well, then add in iii <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of
<m>minium</m>, &amp; pestle well again all together, &amp; put it in the
<tl>crucible</tl>, which you will cover with an appropriate
<tl>tile</tl>, a bit thick, in order that heat reverberates better
there. Then set it on the <tl>grill</tl> of your <tl>fourneau</tl>,
having put under a few thick rounded <tl>squares</tl>. Next, fill your
<tl>furnace</tl> to the opening with <m>charcoal</m>, so that it will be
heaped, and leave it glowing, and always maintain the heat evenly
without letting the <m>charcoal</m> decrease. And for this effect,
always make so that the <tl>furnace</tl> is heaped &amp; full of
<m>charcoal</m>, and maintain it thus for one <ms>day</ms>. The first
experience that I made thus, it only returned a yellow mass, as is only
vitrified <m>minium</m>, &amp; some <ms><fr>grains</fr></ms> of
<m>gold</m> in a mass at the bottom. Try soldered <m>gold</m> and
accompanied with <m>antimony</m>.</ab><m>

If you need greater heat, put on the edge of the opening of the glowing
<tl>furnace</tl> <m>tiles</m>, one against the other, for making the
heat reverberate.</ab>

<head><m>Topaz</m></head>

<ab>The same dose is observed for all <m>gemstones</m>, namely one
<ms>weight</ms> of calcined <m>pebbles</m> on three of <m>minium</m>,
pestling all separately in a <tl><m>copper</m> mortar</tl> for
<m>emerald</m>, &amp; in an <tl><m>iron</m> mortar</tl> for making
<m>topaz</m> or <m>amber</m> color, with <tl>pestles</tl> identical to
the <tl>mortars</tl>. The <m>emerald</m> &amp; the <m>topaz</m> are of
the same heat, &amp; for an <ms>hour</ms> &amp; a half on the fire, for
they could burn. The <m>ruby</m> wants more time &amp; more fire &amp;
colored with <m>gold</m> leaf. I believe that <m>pumice stone</m> or
<m>firestone</m> for the <m>ruby</m> would be better. See the
<m>enamels</m>. Try also mixing, in place of pebbles, pieces of colored
<m>glass</m> or <m>enamels</m>. If the mass is not colored enough,
pestle it more in the <tl><m>iron</m> mortar</tl>.</ab>

Slightly burnt <m>tartar</m> mixed among this makes beautiful yellow,
but one scarcely needs much. The <fr><m>arene</m></fr> also makes it
more yellow.</ab>

<head><m>Salt</m> for melting</head>

<ab>Mix <m>saltpeter</m> &amp; <m>common salt</m> and melt them together
&amp; cast on <m>melted copper</m> or <del><fr>ch</fr></del> in a
<fr>bain</fr>, &amp; it purifies &amp; makes it run marvellously. First,
one ought to decrepitate the <m>common salt</m>, that is to say holding
it over a good fire until it no longer crackles or, to melt it better,
in an <tl><fr>four à vent</fr></tl>. And throw it neatly on
<tl><m>marble</m></tl>, then crush it &amp; grind it very finely, then
put it in a <tl>crucible</tl> on <ms>as much</ms> <m>saltpeter</m> &amp;
let it boil, &amp; mix them together until</ab>

It cleans &amp; purifies <m>metal</m> well.</ab>
