<head>Peach tree</head>

<ab>Because they sprout &amp; flower among the first, &amp; thus are
caught by the frost, one extracts them during winter in order that the
cold slows them, and that blossoming later, the flowers come to
profit.</ab>

<ab>In <pl>Spain</pl>, one extracts them during winter &amp; in summer
one plants them well with earth.</ab>

<head>Foot of <m>bittern</m></head>

<ab>To mold it it is better to extend its fingers and nails on something
flat and let them dry this way for a few days, because in drying the
scales will be rougher and the nerves and and tendons will be more
apparent, and so the molded foot will be more artistic.</ab>

<head>Molds of things which have not been<lb/>

pelted</head>

<ab>Animals who have not been skinned can only be molded in a double
mold, which can only be opened after they have been refired and after
the enclosed animal is completely burnt. Animals with bones or scales
which are not reducible to powder thus remain in calcined pieces which
will never removed from the cast, however much bellowing or whatever
amount of quicksilver is put in, or by using a feather pipe while
molding to make a gate. This is why you mold in two halves: so that once
the mold is opened after having been refired, the thing you've burnt can
be cleaned out. But I advise letting it cool so that in taking off the
clamps (being hot) nothing cracks while it is still fragile. While it is
hot the crust and cinders which it leaves and which stick to the mold
can be more easily removed when it is cold. Also note that on the side
of the lower mold when you reheat the animal, which in boiling leaves a
crust, in this case, always mark on the mold where the back of the
animal is so that in reheating it is to the top and above and will by
this method stay cleaner.</ab>
