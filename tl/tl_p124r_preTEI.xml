<head>Animals with hair and fragile and very thin flowers</head>

<ab>Animals with hair are awkward to mold because the hairs raise up
&amp; come out looking mixed up &amp; <del>to</del> clumped together.
Starting, one ought to keep it flat with something dessicative &amp;
that makes it firmer. And in this, the most singular thing is <m>wheat
oil</m>, with which you will smear it. Once cast, you will be able to
repair it. The bodies of <m>butterflies</m> and <m>plants</m>, that have
the <m>stem</m> &amp; the <m>leaves</m> that are wooly with some hair,
capricious &amp; downy, need also to be smeared with the same
<m>oil</m>, to keep these hairs laid down; likewise <m>flowers</m> that
have <m>leaves</m> very delicate &amp; thin, for dry <m>wheat oil</m>
makes them rigid and firm. And if someone brags about molding what is
presented to them, give them to mold the downy head of the plant called
<m>dandelion</m> or a <pa>pappus</pa>, which comes from the seeds of
<pa>burdock</pa> &amp; flies away at the slightest sigh of wind.</ab>

<head><fr>Noyaulx</fr> for molding hollow</head>

<ab>Animals of <m>gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m> can readily be molded
hollow, to avoid weightiness, and costs as well, if they are not very
small. But to make the core &amp; the <fr>noyau</fr>, one needs the mold
to be freshly molded &amp; not dry.</ab>

<head><al>Spider</al>â€™s web</head>

<ab>It comes undone in <m>water</m> &amp; thusly, cannot be molded in a
<fr>noyau</fr>, but one casts the <m>spider</m> and then one draws the
drawn threads between the grass that they make in the fields on some
<m><fr>carton</fr></m> with a point. One makes around an edge of
<m>paper</m>, glued to the <m><fr>carton</fr></m> &amp; one casts with
<m>tin</m>, very little alloyed with <m>lead</m>.</ab>

<head>Fine <m>gold</m> </head>

<ab>There is a species of <m>gold</m> which, even though it is very fine
&amp; unalloyed &amp; has been passed through <m>aquafortis</m> &amp;
<m>antimony</m>, is however so brittle that it hardly withstands the
hammer. And the composition of <m>verdet</m> described above to make
<m>gold</m> run, makes it as <fr>doux</fr> as <m>lead</m>.</ab></div>
