It can be gathered from the words of <pn>Herodotus</pn> that the
navigation of the <pl>Portuguese</pl> was not newly invented by them as
they brag. At the beginning of the first book entitled <gk>Clio</gk>, he
says that the <pl>Phoenicians</pl> would come from the <pl>Red Sea</pl>
by continuous navigation to the <pl>coast of Greece</pl>, mainly to
<pl>Argos</pl>, to which they would carry merchandise from
<pl>Egypt</pl> &amp; from <pl>Assyria</pl>, which they usually sold out
of within 6 <tmp>days</tmp>.</ab>

Medea</pn>.</ab>

<ab><As <pro>small peddlers</pro> lay open small wares in order to buy
richer ones &amp; to profit more and more, so I, from a desire to learn,

secrets from my benevolent <pro>readers</pro>.</ab>

Aes ustum</head>

<ab>

When it is finely ground it moulds very cleanly. It has a certain
fatness that makes it bind better than filings, &amp; I believe that it
may not be ill suited for casting.</ab>

Rotten wood</head>

<ab>

Wood that is white, being light as a sponge, if burnt in a close fire,
may be used for casting lead in a box and molds very cleanly, but these
things <x>such material</x> do not withstand <x>open?</x> fire. </ab>
