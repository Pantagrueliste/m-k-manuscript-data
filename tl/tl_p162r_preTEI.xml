It can be gathered from the words of Herodotus that the navigation of
the Portuguese was not newly invented by them as they brag. At the
beginning of the first book entitled Clio, he says that the Phoenicians
would come from the Red Sea by continuous navigation to the coast of
Greece, mainly to Argos, to which they would carry merchandise from
Egypt &amp; from Assyria, which they usually sold out of within 6
days.</ab>

Herodotus, on the first page of Clio, says that the Greeks were on a
long ship on the coast of Colchis &amp; to the River Phasis, whence they
carried off Medea.</ab>

Halyattes, the father of Croesus, pateram ex ferro compactilem apud
Delphos dedicavit spectatu dignam inter omnia quae sunt Delphis donaria,
opus Glauci Chii qui solus omnium compactionem ferri excogitavit.

</m>As small peddlers lay open small wares in order to buy richer ones
&amp; to profit more and more, so I, from a desire to learn, am exposing
what little is in my workshop to <del>have through</del> receive,
through a common commerce of letters, much rarer secrets from my
benevolent readers.</ab>

Aes ustum</head>

<ab>

When it is finely ground it moulds very cleanly. It has a certain
fatness that makes it bind better than filings, &amp; I believe that it
may not be ill suited for casting.</ab>

Rotten wood</head>

<ab>

Wood that is white, being light as a sponge, if burnt in a close fire,
may be used for casting lead in a box and molds very cleanly, but these
things <x>such material</x> do not withstand <x>open?</x> fire. </ab>
