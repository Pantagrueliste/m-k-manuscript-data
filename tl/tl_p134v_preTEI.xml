the<del>s</del> borax &amp; <del><m>sel armo</m></del> saltpeter
together must only weigh half of the others, that is to say, as much
together as the verdigris. Grind them finely into powder on marble, then
grind them again with some good strong vinegar until it is fine, like a
color and verdet ground in oil. Next, leave it to dry on its own if you
have time, or in the fire <del>lent</del> of the forge, &amp; make sure
it is well dry.</ab>

For gold casts for large works</head>

<ab>

One needs not only to clamp the molds well, but to fortify them with
good iron wire bands or little bands made for this.</ab>

Before casting in gold, clean your forge well of <m>lead</m> &amp;

<head>Secret for soldering <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m> for small
works</head>

<ab>

If some piece of small leg does not come out well in <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m>, by fault of not having made, underneath, a gate of wax,
beat some soldering gold very thinly, then cut it in as many small
spangles as you need. Take some of this phlegm or white thick
<del>which</del> <m>saliva</m> that is found on the teeth, &amp; with
the point of a burin, apply it to the place you want to solder &amp;
place there a little spangle of gold &amp; next, with a little fat
earth, wet with saliva, make a small layer, on the opposite side, to
hold solder better. Next, pulverize on top a little borax &amp; put in
the fire. Boiled <m>quince seed water</m> &amp; others also.</ab>
