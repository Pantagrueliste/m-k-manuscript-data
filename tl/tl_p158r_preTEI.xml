<head><m>Mercury</m> in the molds for cleaning</head>

<ab>

Heed well that your mold be quite cold before blowing to make the
<m>ash</m> go out, and after put in the <m>☿</m> to achieve the
cleaning. For if the mold is hot, the <m>☿</m> penetrates inside &amp;
flying seeks out conduits, &amp; leaves an odor of itself, which sours
the <m>tin</m> or other <m>metal</m> that you will cast there so much
that it will break if touching the mold at all. The heat of the mold
also retains little grains of <m>☿</m> that make lumps &amp; contracting
to the edge of the molded leaves, are joined there &amp; make the leaves
frangible. The <m>☿</m> cleans the ash well, especially flat things
where there are not delicate tracks which could be broken by its weight.
And by thus, if you can cast neatly without putting it in, do not use
it. But if you have need of it, mix your <m>crocum sand</m> so that it
withstands fire well. And after having put in the <m>☿</m>, evacuate it,
bouncing the end of the mold from below while moving it. Afterwards
reheat your mold gently so that the <m>☿</m> is gone from everywhere. In
this way I cast a branch of periwinkle leaves &amp; flowers very neatly.
Having put a branch of melted <ill/> in the flower, on the back of the
flower <ill/>.</ab>

Reheat your mold until it is good and red before casting, so that the
<m>☿</m> evaporates well.</ab>
