<ab>some thread, as much to secure the plants, in order that they do not
rise <del>par</del> when you throw in your <m>clear sand</m>, as to give
them air when the mold is reheated. For, in doing this, the
<del><tl>mold</tl></del> thread burns &amp; leaves some empty space
around the plants, which serves as vents, &amp; places for evacuating,
&amp; to give air to the plants so that they burn better. For what makes
them stay as charcoal is that they burn in a closed fire &amp; without
empty space because of their fine sprigs. Try, therefore, to enlarge the
main stem with a little <m>melted wax</m> &amp; let it cool, then mold
it. And when the <m>wax</m> melts, it airs it, the principal stem, with
space &amp; as if loose, so that it burns better. Or else, smear them
with <m>oil of <fr>petrol</fr> or sulphur</m>, <m>turpentine</m>, <m>oil
of brick</m>, &amp; similar things, or <m>aqua fortis</m> or
<m>eau-de-vie</m>, or make <m>sands</m> with <m>crocum</m>, lumps of
<m>iron</m>, emery, &amp; things that withstand several days of great
firing.</ab>

<ab>Animal bones are not so difficult to burn &amp; reduce to ashes,
because the flesh, once burned, the bones remain loose &amp; the weight
of the <m>quicksilver</m> makes them break &amp; disintegrate, once
calcined &amp; burnt.</ab>

Asparagus always stays as charcoal, like little pins. Try to take it,
and thyme, at the beginning, when they are growing, so that their stem
is still thin.</ab>

<head>Molds of plaster for <m>wax</m></head>

<ab>When your mold of plaster is done &amp; dried, take heed that your
mold be of good release, for sometimes it happens that the animal, being
wounded or thin &amp; withered, makes wrinkles, where <del>retire</del>
there being some scales, that is where the plaster enters. And this not
being of good release, the wax animal attaches itself &amp; breaks &amp;
you would never have it perfect. Take heed also to make your gates for
the wax very wide. Thusly &amp; that the gates are not too thick. They
are made when <del>the animal is</del><figure>
