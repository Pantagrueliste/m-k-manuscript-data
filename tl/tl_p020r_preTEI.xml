<head>@For making <m><oc>millas</oc></m></head>

<ab>It is necessary to have the <m>millet</m> pilled to remove the
<m>husks</m> and then you will clean it well. Next it is necessary to
grind it again quite finely and pass through a <tl>hair sieve</tl> quite
finely. This done, it is necessary to soak the <m>flour</m> with melted
fresh <m>butter</m> and some <m>milk</m>, and that there be as much of
one as the other, such that it is very light in color, like the
<m>dough</m> to make <m>fritters</m>. And you will put in <m>egg
yolks</m> according to the quantity of <m>flour</m>, so that it amounts
to two <m>egg yolks</m> for each <m><oc>millas</oc></m>. Then you will
put in some <m><pa>saffron</pa></m>, if you like, to give them a little
color.</ab>

<ab>It is necessary, next, to have some <tl>molds</tl>, and it is
necessary that they be <m>earthenware</m>, in the shape of the crown of
a catholic hat, but it is necessary that it be open at both ends. And
then, having made a good fire, you will clean the heawhere you want to
put your <m>millas</m> and then take your <tl>mold</tl>s and grease them
very well so that the <m>pastry</m> does not stick to them when baked.
Once you have done that, put your <tl>mold</tl>s in a place in the
<tl>oven</tl> where you clean and sprinkle a bit of <m>flour</m> on the
bottom and fill them with some of the aforementioned <m>pastry</m>. Then
you will cover the said <tl>mold</tl>s, with a <tl>lid</tl> made like
the <tl>mold</tl>, but it must be bigger and not open at the top. Then
once done, you will put some <m>straw</m> on the said <tl>lid</tl> and a
lot of hot <m>charcoal</m>, and set a fire around it, once done, you
will open up one of them after a bit of time and will see when it is
baked, it will be hard.</ab>

<head>@<pro>Glazier</pro></head>

<ab><m>Glass from <pl>Lorraine</pl></m> is smoother &amp; more even than
<m>plate glass</m> and it is sturdier &amp; more durable. But commonly
it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which happens
because the <pro>glassmakers</pro>, having made it, put it when totally
hot on <m><pa>straw</pa></m>, which stains it in this way. However, this
is removed with <m>varnish</m> &amp; <m>salt</m> &amp; other
<m>drugs</m> that the <pro>glaziers</pro> put in. <m>Glass from
<pl>Lorraine</pl></m> is sold by <ms><fr>lien</fr></ms> &amp; each
<ms><fr>lien</fr></ms> is composed of three <ms>tablets</ms>. The
<ms><fr>lien</fr></ms> costs usually x <cn><fr>sous</fr></cn>. <m>Plate
glass</m> <del>sold in</del> is made in <pl>France</pl>, it is whiter
&amp; clearer, but alternately it is not so durable as that from
<pl>Lorraine</pl>. It is also commonly blown &amp; in that case, it is
better to make little diamonds rather than large square pieces in the
shape of the frame, because they are not able to seat themselves very
evenly.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>

<m>Plate glass</m> is sold by <ms><fr>paniers</fr></ms>. Every
<ms><fr>panier</fr></ms> contains 24 <ms>plates</ms> that are commonly
sold at x or twelve <cn>lb</cn>.</ab>
