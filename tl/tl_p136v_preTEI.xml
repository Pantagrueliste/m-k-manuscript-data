<head>For casting with <m>latten</m></head>

<ab>

The <m>latten</m> from skillets, where one makes the mush for little
children, which is <fr>doulx</fr> is appropriate for the cast. Some say
that German tokens <del>are</del> contains a lot of calamine. However,
as they are thin, the calamine exhales out when melting them, as it does
in all <del>meta</del> remelted latten, which through melting again
returns red. However, fresh calamine &amp; on its own, put again on
melted latten, makes it run &amp; cast neatly, because the one that is
in the remelted latten is half corrupted in its natural state, &amp;
makes it become porous &amp; blusters because it is disposed to
exhaling. Therefore use calamine alone, on its own, very recent, on the
melted latten. Take heed to cast very hot &amp; that your mold be red
like for gold, silver, copper &amp; metal. If you cast with recent
calamine, keep yourself away from the smoke, for it is pernicious. I
wanted to use German tokens to cast medals &amp; took thirty &amp; xii
nails of <fr>rosette</fr>, like for chairs, which are of <fr>doulx</fr>
latten. This substance, containing a lot of calamine, like all strong
yellow latten, strongly smoked, which is what prevents latten from
running and makes it porous. Make many vents &amp; cast very hot, that
your latten is white like water or melted silver &amp; similar to a very
polished steel mirror. The second fusion comes out better, because there
is exhaled calamine and does not make as much smoke. If it is in a
frame, which does not break &amp; withstands <del>a</del>, the second
cast comes out neat, because it is imbued with calamine smoke, which
embraces &amp; receives the second one. Sal ammoniac alone, put in
latten, renders it net &amp; shiny. <fr>Huile tingente</fr> even more
so. It does not need any sand other than the previous in <fr>noyau</fr>
&amp; that the mold be red like for gold. Make many vents. And if you
cast yellowed latten with the prepared tutty, you will not have any bad
smoke.</ab>

This metal is very fanciful to cast, because of the calamine smoke, and
one ought not leave it <del>pass</del> rest even a little bit outside
the fire, like some do with silver, for it is immediately cold when it
feels the air and the wind. It always leaves some type of tail, like
glass, when you cast it. Casters do not usually take such yellow latten,
because of the calamine passed through the fire. But when wanting to
cast red copper, they yellow it either with fresh calamine, or with
prepared tutty. Wanting to cast, one purifies it well of charcoal, with
a stalk of copper or iron, and one covers it with a cloth, soaked in pig
fat, mixed with saltpeter or sal ammoniac to keep it from the wind &amp;
from cooling. </ab>
