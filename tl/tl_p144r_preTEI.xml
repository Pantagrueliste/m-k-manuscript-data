<ab>Those of water are more beautiful &amp; easier to mould <del>than
those</del>, being flatter &amp; having a longer head &amp; tail
<del>q</del> and legs straighter &amp; better to release than those of
the <fr>garrigue</fr>, which are lean, wrinkled &amp; well ensconced in
their shell, which also have a rounder top of the shell &amp; however
narrower <del>v</del> on the sides than near the middle, which is the
reason their <del>l</del> top shell cannot be molded well in one piece,
like those of the water. <del>Therefore</del> Thusly, you will mold
their top shell in two pieces, the bottom ones in two or three of four,
according to the need. But, note that if you want to release your turtle
from the mold without burning it, it needs to be molded it thus in
several pieces. But, if you want it to be burned <del>p</del> inside,
you can mold the top shell in one piece. Therefore, to start working
hands-on, after you have killed it entirely in vinegar &amp; urine, as
said, let it dry well. And clean it well with your cloth. Next,
<del>not</del>, take your clay slab, and smudge it a little, and put it
on top so that the bottom shell fastens to it, having, nevertheless,
earlier shaped the head with a strong point, as with other animals,
making it hold high by the means of <del>one</del> a little fresh clay,
that you will adapt from underneath. Stretch the said head &amp; legs
with your little pincers. The head arranged, dexterously place
<del>d</del> a grain of yellow millet in each eye with pincers, because
as soon as they are dead the eyes are burst and filthy. You can do this
as well with all other small animals, with the grain of large amaranth,
the small one, and the grain of rapeseed, &amp; this done, you will
arrange the legs, securing them with iron points and then, with some
clay, fill up all the empty space around the turtle, that is to say what
is between the two shells, in order that the sand entering there does
not prevent it from releasing. And because the legs should be lower than
the shell of the <del>s</del> <del>e</del> <del>de</del> belly, make a
little pit in the clay slab to adapt them there. Your turtle</ab>

When they are better mortified &amp; rested two or three days, they bend
and are handled better.</ab>
