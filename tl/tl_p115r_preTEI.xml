<ab>
if you want, which will be enough, or else on the two halves. But
because one needs to cast by the tail or from the back of the animal,
make it so that the vents come from the head &amp; the middle of the
body to respond to the tail, where the cast is done, which is the end of
the mandore. And having done your cast, do not forget to make in it some
holes and notches because the metal will run more neatly, as if the cast
was even, for it gets corrupted in its notches &amp; holes, &amp;does
not go so much at once, &amp; does not become as porous. This done, join
the two halves of your mold &amp; strengthen the joints, putting around
these some small clamps of iron wire of this shape. They prevent the
molds from deforming &amp; corrupting while reheating.</ab>

<head>Warning about the above said.</head>

<ab>If your snake has been without eating for a long time, it happens
that, when you want to kill it in <m>urine</m> &amp; <m>vinegar</m>, it
fills with a lot of <m>water</m> &amp; swells, and next it dries out as
you fix &amp; arrange it on the clay <fr>tourtelle</fr>, and next it
happens that when you have cast your wet sand on it, &amp; it has set,
it ends up coming out such that between the snake and animal there is a
line of distance, in which enters the second batch of cast wet sand.
Avoid this therefore if you can. But if this cannot be, do not let this
prevent your second cast, for the sand which will enter in this void,
will be so weak that it will easily be removed with a small point, &amp;
will not have set with the first hardened one.</ab>

<ab>Note that one needs more <m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m> for molds
which should be reheated, like those for <m>gold</m> &amp;
<m>silver</m>, &amp; things that one needs to burn inside, than those
which release well, &amp; and that are only for casting <m>lead</m>
&amp; <m>tin</m>. However do not put too much in one or the other. </ab>

<head>Animal after release</head>

<ab>If, by chance, you gave your snake such a writhing shape, such that
the place of the stomach cannot easily come out, especially since the
head &amp; the tail, which are the two ends, are thinner, cut everything
which is outside, &amp; reheat the mold so well that what remained
inside burns, then pass some quicksilver inside &amp; attracting the
ashes &amp; the burnt bones from the inside, it will also come out,
because the conduit is big, &amp; thus will not sour at all your
substance. You can pull really strongly the molded snake, because it is
soft &amp; malleable &amp; obedient &amp; the mold, having set, is so
firm that because of this the imprint will not be spoiled at all. </ab>

<head>A reheating of the molds</head>

<ab>After your molds have been reheated &amp; and cleaned, the sooner
casted is best, because if you keep them, they get corrupted and
dampened. Reheat the thickest, where the body of the animal is, cast as
soon as possible, because if you keep your molds it will corrode and
become damp. Reheat the thickest part, where the body of the animal is,
at the top, so that , if there is something inside to burn, it falls to
the bottom.</ab>

<ab>Mark the part on top to recognize it</ab>

<ab>It is only a good thing to leave the mold to cool a little outside,
one well reheated, because it remains red on the inside when you will
cast.</ab>
