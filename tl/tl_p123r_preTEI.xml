<ab>Take these substances, of the best kind you can find. Weigh them as
said above, and pestle them separately, keeping your face covered, over
the nose &amp; the mouth, from the eyes down, to avoid the exhalations
of <m>arsenic</m>, <m>sublimate</m>, and <m>orpiment</m>. Mix them well
all together, then put them in a good crucible that is so large that the
substances can have space of the fourth or fifth part. Cover the
crucible with a good tile, adapted in a circle precisely on its opening.
And having bound it from top to bottom and on the sides with iron wire
quite strongly, lute it with <m>earth mixed with dung</m> or
<m>founder’s earth</m>,that <pro>artillery founders</pro> use. And in
this, be careful &amp; diligent, &amp; do not forget to mix in
<m>crushed glass</m> throughout the lute to fortify your crucible, in a
way that it takes no air, for the substance would be worth little,
because the <del>4</del> <add>five</add> last ingredients would be
exhaled. </ab>

Note that you need to lute well your <tl>crucible</tl>, so that the
substances do not take air, for they would be exhaled.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>

Lute well your <tl>crucible</tl>, in order that it does not break. For
if it breaks, the substances evaporate &amp; the fumes in it are
dangerous. If within 12 hours it is not melted and mixed, it will not be
well made. </ab>

<pro>Goldsmiths</pro> who know about this substance sell a
<fr><ms>denier</ms></fr> of it for 5 <fr><cn>sols</cn></fr> to other
<pro>goldsmiths</pro>, &amp; especially to those who make dishware in
quantity, for at the end of their works, they can solder over the first
solder by means of this mixture. In general, all those who want to mold
&amp; cast something delicate. This mixture should not be divulged, in
order that it is not abused.</ab>
