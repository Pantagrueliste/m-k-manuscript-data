<ab>They completely melt <m>orpiment</m> in a <tl><m>glass</m>
bottle</tl> on very hot ashes, but it would be more appropriate to
sublimate <m>orpiment</m> in a long-necked <tl>matrass</tl> as for
making <m>garnets</m>. The <m>orpiment</m> thus turns red like <m>red
enamel</m> &amp; one needs to grind it damp because once completely
melted it is very lively &amp; difficult to grind. Next, you can
<del><fr>br</fr></del> thin it, once dry, with <m>oil</m> &amp; it will
make a deep yellow of heightened color. But to prevent <m>orpiment</m>
from dying with the other colors &amp; to render it compatible with
these &amp; to make it dry promptly, it is held a very rare secret to
calcine <m>common salt</m> &amp; to grind it within. <m>Green
verditer</m> is not used with <m>oil</m>.</ab>
