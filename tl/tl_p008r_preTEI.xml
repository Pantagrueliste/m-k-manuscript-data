<head>Tempering for balls for piercing bullet-proof armor</head>

<ab>Heat the <m>lead</m> ball as much as you can without melting it, and
when it will be very hot, temper it in the strongest <m>vinegar</m> that
you can. And do this four or five times. Next, chop some <m>lard</m>
very small &amp; some <m>linen</m> also very finely, mix all together
&amp; it serves as your wadding, and by a little force &amp; very
precisely, make it to go into the arquebus or pistol. And before
shooting, make it if possible so that the ball should be hot.</ab>
