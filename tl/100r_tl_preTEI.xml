<ab>To quickly make a layer of <fr><m>or <del><fr>sur</fr></del> mat</m></fr> on <m>canvas</m> or  other <m>oil panel</m>, one makes fatty <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> <env>in the sun</env> or <env>on the fire</env>, as said above, for it thickens by itself in this way, although there is neither <m>lead</m>, nor <m>ceruse</m>. And with this, grind <fr><m>massicot</m></fr>, <m>mine</m>, &amp; other desiccatives, not <fr><m>verdet</m></fr> nor <m>orpiment</m>, for they cause the <m>gold</m> to die. It will be dry soon. However, if the <env><tmp>weather is not clear &amp; dry</tmp></env>, do not shade it, for if the <env><tmp>weather is damp &amp; humid</tmp></env>, it would turn black.</ab>

<ab>One needs to carefully <sn>observe</sn> the eyes, the nose, &amp; the beard, for these three things make strong resemblance.</ab>

<ab>One needs to pound your materials in a thick <m>glass</m> <tl>mortar</tl> coated with <m>mastic</m>, &amp; encased &amp; into another <m>wooden</m> <tl>mortar</tl>, so that it does not break, this can be useful to <pro>perfumers</pro>, &amp; <del>la t</del> use a <m>glass</m> <tl>pestle</tl> too.</ab>

<head>Vitrified <m>saltpeter</m></head>


<ab>
Melted with <m>pebbles</m>, it makes the <m>glass</m> very white. But rather, it needs to be calcined on a hot tile or <tl>paddle</tl>. And mix the liquid remains of the vapor with as much white, calcined <m>pebbles</m>. It is true that, in the little <tl>oven</tl>, it does not make it very clear. But for big windows, it makes the <m>glass</m> very clear, &amp; white &amp; clean.</ab>

<head>Windows through which the sun will not pass</head>


<ab>Take the aforementioned calcined <m>saltpeter</m> &amp; expose it to a humid air or place, and it will convert itself into a liquid which, if rubbed on both sides of the windows, the sun will not pass through; rather, it will cast shade. One needs to put the <m>saltpeter</m> on any clean place, &amp; put glowing <m>coals</m> on it, and continue all over until it no longer burns.</ab>

It also serves for melting &amp;for adding in with <m>alkali salt</m> for cleaning <bp>hands</bp>.</ab>
