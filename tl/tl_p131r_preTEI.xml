<ab>Mold them with two or three gates, which once reheated will open

inside. </ab>

<head>Letters and molded <m>paper</m></head>

<ab>Write with well gummed <m>ink</m> or with any <m>color</m> which has
body &amp; which does not erase once moistened with <fr>eau-de-vie</fr>.
Then, place your paper on a clay slab &amp; moisten it with
<fr>eau-de-vie</fr> and cast on one side &amp; the other.</ab>

<head>For adorning beds, mirrors and similar things</head>

<ab>Model any drawing in half relief on a flat <m>slate</m> in order to
set it on round or flat things. Cast with very fine <m>tin</m>, then you
can gild it with <m>gold</m> leaf, and set it wherever you want. Fill
the bottom of the relief with small <m>rubies</m>, <m>orpiment</m>, or
any colored little <m>grains</m>.</ab>

<head>To teach a dog well</head>

<ab>You need to keep your dog attached; when it does what you command,
to win its love, give it a piece of <m>cheese</m> that was held under
the armpit. This <m>cheese</m> would be a bad drug if the master, or the
apprentice, is red-haired. </ab>

<head>Molded <m>waxes</m></head>

<ab>Figures of wax composed of ceruse &amp; lead white are not for
burning &amp; melting in a mold where you want to cast gold &amp;
silver, for this would sour it. And then, if you think about taking away
these waxes composed of things coming from the metals reheated in the
mold, you will be wrong, because, the asperity of the fire, making them
boil, the wax goes away &amp; the composition of the ceruse or other
metallic color, attached to the mold. And for this reason, if you want
to rough out something</ab>
