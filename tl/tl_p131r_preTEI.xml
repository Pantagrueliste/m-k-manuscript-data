<ab>Write with well gummed <m>ink</m> or with any <m>color</m> which has
body &amp; which does not erase once moistened with <fr>eau-de-vie</fr>.
Then, place your paper on a clay slab &amp; moisten it with

<ab>Rough out some design in half relief on a quite flat <m>slate</m> to
adapt it to either round or flat things. And having cast it in mixed
<m>tin</m>, quite thin, you can gild it with <m>gold</m> leaf, &amp;

bottom of the relief with small <m>rubies</m>, <m>orpiment</m>, &amp;

<ab>Figures of wax composed of ceruse &amp; lead white are not for
burning &amp; melting in a mold where you want to cast gold &amp;
silver, for this would sour it. And then, if you think about taking away
these waxes composed of things coming from the metals reheated in the
mold, you will be wrong, because, the asperity of the fire, making them
boil, the wax goes away &amp; the composition of the ceruse or other
metallic color, attached to the mold. And for this reason, if you want
