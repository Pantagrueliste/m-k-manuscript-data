<ab>Make a small sheath of plain leather, such as cow or morocco,
somewhat thick, as tall as three fingers, sewn like the finger of a
glove &amp; large enough that two fingertips can fit inside &amp; which,
at the tip, which is a little puckered, has a round hole as large as a
double liard. Take two similar <m>boxwood</m> balls, &amp; let one be
hollow &amp; open with a round hole on one side only so that the thimble
can fit inside. Thus, when you want to perform, you will place your
<m>leather</m> sheath on the table with the ball that is not hollow.
Pass a stick inside the <m>leather</m> sheath to show that there is
nothing there, also show the full ball, and hold the one which is hollow
&amp; has the thimble inside it by your little &amp; ring fingers, and
do this with your right hand with which you are holding the stick.
After, you take your <m>leather</m> sheath &amp; place it over the
hollow ball which is in your fingers, &amp; making it seem as if you are
putting some <m><la>oribus</la> powder</m> over it, you put back the
<m>leather</m> mold that contains the ball with the thimble on the
table, then you take the full &amp; solid ball remaining on the table,
and command it to enter from under the table into the <m>leather</m>
sheath. Then, lifting the <m>leather</m>, the ball seems to be the same,
although it is the hollow one. Then cover it again &amp; command it to
become invisible. And then, lifting the sheath while pressing it, you
will remove it and the ball along with it; &amp; putting it aside with
the sheath, in its place will be found a thimble for the ladies whose
bottom hurts, that is to say, the bottom of the needle.</ab>
