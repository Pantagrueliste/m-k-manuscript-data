<head>To soak <m>sand</m></head>

<ab>You need to have a big basin full of <m>water</m> to soak the molds
to open them, a tankard full of <m>common water</m>, a lead bowl for
soaking your sand, a small <m>wooden</m> spoon to collect the soaked
<m>sand</m> in the bowl.</ab>

To make handles for your large oil brushes, if you do not have large
enough <m>feather quills</m>, take two of them, &amp; split them &amp;
join them together.</ab>

<head>Molding en <fr>noyau</fr>. Mixture of <m>sand</m></head>

<ab>Having reheated your <m>sand</m>, namely the <m>plaster</m>, the
<m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m> &amp; the <m>brick</m>, &amp; having
passed them finely through the sieve, <figure>#</figure> mix them this
way, take four parts of <m>plaster</m>, two of <m>brick</m>, &amp; one
of <m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m>. Mix them all together with your hands,
in such a way that one cannot discern one from the other. With your
<m>sand</m> ready, you need to kill the animal that you want to mold in
this way.</ab>

<head>Killing the animal to be molded</head>

<ab>It is necessary that you be scrupulous to not wound it at all in
taking it. And having put it in a glass bottle with some bran, or in a
barrel half full of fresh &amp; damp earth, if you want to stock them or
keep them a long time, give them live frogs and not dead ones to eat,
for if you keep them without feeding them, they wither &amp; grow thin,
&amp; have long wrinkled skins. Thus the best would be to mold it as
soon as possible after it has been taken. But before, kill it in this
way. Place it in a clean bottle or vessel so that it collects no
<m>dust</m>. And put inside a sufficient quantity of good vinegar and
urine so that it can be covered. And shake and torment it inside, until
it is dead, which will be in on or a half hour. But if you are in a
hurry</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
To know if it is quite dead, take it out of the <m>vinegar</m> and take
it by the tail. If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling,
&amp; when piercing it, it would retract &amp; spoil the mold.</ab>
