<ab>Grate <m><pa>brazilwood</pa></m> very finely, put it to soak one or
two <ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms> in <m>clear water</m>, then take this
<m>tinted water</m> &amp; add to it some <m>clear water</m> &amp; you
will make <del><fr>e</fr></del> <m>wine</m> as clear as you like. If you
please, put a <ms>drop</ms> of <m>lemon or orange juice</m> in it &amp;
it will immediately turn white. It can be drunk without danger.

<head><pro>Arquebusier</pro></head>

<ab>For shooting your arquebus precisely, it is necessary that the end
of the breech be &amp; come precisely on the edge of the touch-hole,
because in this manner the <m>powder</m> catches &amp; burns all at once
without blowing &amp; has more force &amp; does not push back. On the
contrary, if the breech is made hollow, as they commonly are, the
<m>powder</m> catches sooner in this place, makes it push back, and
blows, which a chambered arquebus clearly shows, because it pushes back
more than another. And since the barrel is bigger at the breech than at
the muzzle the sights are also uneven, for that at the breech is higher
than that at the muzzle. And then, the thickness of the barrel is
greater than the caliber by about one line, and the sight by another. It
would therefore be necessary to either make the cannon all of one size
or to raise the barrel from the end &amp; towards the muzzle, &amp; push
it in and lower towards the breech. The weight of the <m>powder</m> must
be one third of the <x>weight of the</x> bullet.

<head>Hail shot for the arquebus</head>

<ab>If you want that it stays together put a piece of <m>felt</m> or
<m>leather</m> or <m>paper</m> on it, depending on the distance, and let
the piece be made with a form precisely cut depending on the caliber of
the arquebus.
