<head>To tell someone that you will teach him something he does not
know, and neither do you</head>

<ab>Take a string or a small stick and take the measurement from the tip
of his ear to the tip of his nose and show it to him. Thus you will
teach him something you did not know, and neither did he.</ab>

<ab>According to the strength of your knives, either kitchen or table,
you will make them support a large weight on their tips laid down &amp;
arranged in a triangle, edge to edge, as you can see, &amp; they would
not touch the ground. And if, after arranging them this way, you turn
them the other way without unjoining them, the tips of the handles can
also support a large weight without touching the ground. You can just as
well adapt this to another use with pikes, with joists, or to quickly
make a tripod in a camp with three halberd tips. If the edge of the
knife marked A faces from right to left, the butts of the handles will
rise, but if the edge of the same knife faces from left to right, the
tips will rise.</ab>
