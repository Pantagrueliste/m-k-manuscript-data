<head>Ash in the molds</head>

<ab>One needs to let the mold cool before blowing to make the ashes go
out. For when the mold is hot, they adhere against it &amp; once cold,
they separate from it more easily, &amp; go out from it by blowing with
air <fr>en vapeur</fr>.</ab></div>

<head>Molding a <al>bird</al></head>

<ab>One needs to give it its shape. And to do this, place it on its side
on a <m>clay</m> slab, and hide &amp; sink within it half the aforesaid
<al>bird</al>, <add>in order</add> that it only shows one leg &amp; one
foot, then you will grease it with <m>butter</m> to make it hold the
feathers down, finally <del>d<m>huile</m></del> <m>eau-de-vie</m>. And
then cast. And having made this take, clean &amp; uncover whatever needs
it. Next mold the other side in the same way. But because the feet,
being of bone that is difficult to burn, &amp; which will not be able to
be cleaned neither with <m>quicksilver</m>, nor by any other means, if
the mold does not open, uncover the bottom of the foot and the toe, or
the nail of the claw, and mold <sup>it with</sup>a separate piece. Make
a second cooking and open your mold and clean the bones. Feet generally
remain <sup>too</sup> weak to support the a heavy <al>bird</al>. Because
of this one adapts an <m>iron</m> thread in the foot mold which goes
through the body before you cast. In this way they are reinforced. Some
mold the wings in a frame. Some mold the head and the aforesaid wings
separately en noyau, then reattach and repair them to start shaping
<sup><al>the bird</al></sup>, which will firstly have a rigid shape and
support the tempered sand.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>They are skinned and filled with
<m>cotton cloth</m>. And for the best result, you must prepare it in the
way that <pro>leather-workers</pro> do, so that they do not lose their
comely feathers. The preparation is made of <m>alum</m> and <m>flour
paste</m>.</ab>
