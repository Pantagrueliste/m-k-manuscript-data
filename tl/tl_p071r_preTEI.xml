<ab>It softens like <m>paste</m> when boiled in melted <m>wax</m>, and
takes color boiled with <m>fat of a young <al>goat</al></m>, for that of
a <al>goat</al> would make it break, principally if it is glazed.</ab>

<ab>The <m><pa>elm</pa></m>, in its knotty root, has beautiful streaks
diversified with grey and black, and the <m>root of the
<pa>maple</pa></m>, but one needs to chose well the grain of the
<m>wood</m>. One gives the <m><pa>maple</pa></m> a certain yellow color,
then one varnishes it.</ab>

<head><m>Mulled</m> and <m>sugared wine</m></head>

<ab>

When the <pl>English</pl> have a cold, they mull <m>wine</m> in this
manner. They heat it in a <del>large</del> <m>tin</m> pot until it
boils, and when it is boiling up, they <del>remove it from</del> light
it with burning <m>paper</m> to know if it is hot enough. Next, to
ignite it entirely, they pour it from one vessel into another, as one
who wants to beat <m><fr>eau pan√©e</fr></m>, and as they are doing this,
someone else lights with a burning <m>paper</m> what is falling from one
vessel into the other, such that you would think you were pouring fire.
When the <m>wine</m> is mulled enough, heat it again a little, adding a
few <m>cloves</m> &amp; a sufficient quantity of <m>sugar</m>. And they
<del>dri</del> <del/> drink it as hot as they can to overcome a
cold.</ab>

<ab>

<margin>left-middle</margin>

The common <pl>English</pl> put <m>sugar</m> in the <m>wine</m> to
imitate for themselves the sweet new <m>wine</m> which they cannot have
because, owing to the long sea crossing, the <m>wine</m> has lost its
sweetness and is clarified before it reaches their country.</ab>

<head>Weary <al>horses</al></head>

<ab>For fortifying a harried <al>horse</al>, they make it drink some of
the aforesaid <m>wine</m> through a horn, and it finds itself disposed
for doing an even greater labor.</ab></div>

<head><m>Eau de vie</m></head>

<ab>The <al>Irish</al> do not drink any <m>wine</m> because they convert
it into <m>spirits</m>, which they use almost as habitually as we use
<m>wine</m>.</ab>
