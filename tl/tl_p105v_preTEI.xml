<ab>Next, when it will be well taken, cut the top of the tree that
exceeds your tree, three or 4 fingers above the shield for the first
time, and then, at the closest point, in order that is closed. But heed
well that when you will make your shield no small hole remains at the
back of the sprout, for this would signify to you that its root would be
broken, &amp; your graft would never take; but make it so that the back
is intact. This type of grafting is practiced from mid-May, so that the
trees have already budded &amp; made new output, until the beginning of
August, and so that the trees are in sap. Almond trees, which are
naturally drier, lose their sap earlier, therefore those who want to
graft onto them mericotons, apricots &amp; grafts of trees with pitted
fruit, which are the best there, they are grafted in the month of
January. Generally trees with pitted fruit, like <fr>mericoton</fr>
peaches, are grafted in clefts. One says that trees grafted <fr>en
piolet</fr> or <fr>escusson</fr> are later to bear fruit than those
<fr>en fente</fr>.</ab>

<ab>It would not be very scrupulous to cultivate in one's garden
<fr>armols</fr>, because, when soup &amp; broth is kept a little bit
cold, it creates <al>worms</al> in it.</ab>

<ab>Recooked <m>plaster</m> runs when mixed with <m>water</m>, which you
will see in the next recipe about wet molds. When put on the joints of
the fountain conduits, <sup>it</sup> resists as much as any

<head>Taking <al>nightingales</al>

<add>See the 15th folio after this.</add></head>

<ab>For trapping them, one needs to observe their nature, the food that
they like the best, &amp; the season of their pleasure. The
<al>nightingale</al>, as long as he sings, maintains a territory for
himself alone. Approach thus, making as if searching the ground for
something. And having some <al>worms</al> which come from old meal or
from beneath, made by kneading or by mills, from where the
<al>nightingale</al> is quite pleased, put some on your hat attached
with a pin or otherwise, in order that it wiggles. And at five or six
steps from the hedge where it sings, make a hole in the soil &amp; put
in some <al>worms</al>, and your device of little criss-crossed sticks.
As soon as you leave it will be anxious to go see what you have done,
and seeing some <al>worms</al> it will enter.</ab>

trees.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>The coolness of the evening and the
morning, near fountains &amp; shaded places, are more appropriate for
taking them.</ab>

<ab>It is necessary that the iron wire of its cage be of the thickest
possible, in order that thinking of leaving, it will not be hurt. Cover,
from the moment that it is taken, its cage with canvas. One needs to
force feed it the first day, taking it out from its cage into the hand
&amp; opening its beak, &amp; with a small wooden pin, put it in its
throat &amp; make it swallow. And continue thus until it is no longer
opinionated. This is done for sustaining it, for if it would become thin
it would die.</ab>

<ab>It is necessary for him to have a cage made in the barn, like those
for <al>calendras</al>, doubled with green cloth, because he fears the
cold. And for making him accustomed to eating when first he is put in
the cage, one needs to give him <al>ants</al> with soil from the bottom
of the cage to make it accustomed to pecking, and give him chopped
<al>sheep</al>'s heart, &amp; immediately some eggs, &amp;
<al>mealworms</al>.</ab></div>
