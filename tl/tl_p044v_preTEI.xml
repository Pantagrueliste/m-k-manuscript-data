<head><m><al>Horse</al>hair sieves</m></head>

<ab>They are made often in <pl>Normandy</pl> with <m><al>horse</al>tail
hairs</m> that they clean with some washing <m>water</m> because they
pick them out with their mouth and separate short and broken ones. They
do not make the <m>thread</m> longer than the sieve and it is round.
They attach the black or white <m>hair</m> at the two edges of the
thread, according to the piece they want to make. And the thread is
woven above and below like any other fabric. And passing a small flat
stick of ii or three fingers wide between two, they pass between after
two bits of hair at each step strike and weave with three steps. The
entire sieve is made of xvii bits of <m>hair</m>. They sell them by
dozens and each xxx sols. They bring them to <pl>Toulouse</pl> to send
them then to <pl>Spain</pl> and there, they exchange it with
<m>silk</m>.</ab></div>

<head>Excellent <m>water</m> against the pest by <pn>Monsieur de
Montorsin</pn></head>

<ab>Take some <m>theriac</m>, <m><pa>rue</pa></m> &amp;
<m><pa>dittany</pa></m>, &amp; <m>good vinegar</m>, put the whole in a
<tl><m>glass</m> bottle</tl>, leave it half-open &amp; well fixed, and
put it in a very long bath for three or 4 <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>. Then
separate your decoction from the residue, of which <sup>decoction</sup>
in time of need you will pour some, on a <tl>flaming red tile</tl> &amp;
receive the vapor of it &amp; also perfume your clothes with it. This is
a very rare &amp; tested secret.</ab></div>

<ab>For <m>glueing</m> <m>stone</m>, some do not use

<ms>as much <del>as</del> of one as the other</ms>, &amp; as much of

<m>wax</m> as the two, and mix it with <m>crushed brick</m> for greater
