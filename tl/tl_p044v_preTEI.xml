They do not make the <m>reed</m> longer than the sieve, &amp; the reed
is round. They attach to both edges of the reed the <m>hair</m>, either

<ab>Take some <m>theriac</m>, <m><pa>rue</pa></m> &amp;
<m><pa>dittany</pa></m>, &amp; <m>good vinegar</m>, put the whole in a
<tl><m>glass</m> bottle</tl>, leave it half-open &amp; well fixed, and
put it in a very long bath for three or 4 <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>. Then

receive the vapor of it &amp; also perfume your clothes with it. This is
