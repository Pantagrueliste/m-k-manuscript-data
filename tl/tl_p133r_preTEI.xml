<head>Hard <m>wax</m> for imprinting seals</head>

<ab>It is made from white <m>wax</m>, which is harder than the other,
&amp; one mixes in very finely ground <m>ceruse</m> or <m>lead white</m>
until it becomes as hard as you fancy, adding to it a drop of
<m>turpentine</m> to bind it. Next mix in whatever color you want. That
is the <m>wax</m> <pro>goldsmiths</pro> use for modeling.</ab>

<head>Feet of small<del>s</del> <al>lizards</al> for <m>gold</m> and
<m>silver</m></head>

<ab>Because the feet of these, which are very small, are very delicate,
as you molded the top and <del>d</del> uncovered the belly &amp; the
bottom of the feet, cover them lightly with wax &amp; then cast the
second mold. And the wax being removed, it leaves a <del>g</del> little
gate for the aforesaid feet. And should the bottom of these come of in
one piece, you can repair it. And the scales from the top of the toes
will come out well.</ab>

At the end of the nails of large lizards, place <del>make</del> on each
one a little circle of wax, to make the gate thusly :</ab>

<head>Marks from the points of iron wire which are found on the head of
the animal</head>

<ab><del>L</del>With the points, one has previously set the shape,
especially that of the head. But the head being pierced, there remains
around the hole some moisture and a little excretion , which hinders the
sand from covering the point &amp; there always remains some little
opening<del>g</del>. But to avoid this, you can plant in the slab a iron
point, <del>arro</del> cleaned &amp; rounded at the top end &amp; on
this end place there a little hard wax or <del>du</del> some mastic or
cement, and through the means of this hot iron wire, hold thre the
throat of the animal, which can be removed when you come to uncover the
belly &amp; the throat to make the second cast.</ab>

<head>Clamps and broken mold</head>

<ab>When you have made the first reheating &amp; removed the clamps, and
you have <del>the</del> opened your mold to clean it by blowing, with
quicksilver, which is used only in enclosed molds, close the mold again
&amp; put the clamps on again, but not in the first place where they
were. Lut again &amp; dry again. But if it is for a cast with silver or
gold, lute with the remainder of the sand that was used, for it is the
safest. If you mold, while reheating, is broken, you can adjust it with
some clamps &amp; lute.</ab>
