<ab> like other things, &amp; on this occasion, you can cast in two or
three times until your mold is full. As for the mold which is of white
plaster, pulverized &amp; reheated as for previous sands, you should
have made it a long time ago, for it serves several times. But before
you use it, soak it for a good hour in cold water &amp; for at least as
long in water so hot, that, at the beginning, you cannot hold your
finger in it. And <del>q</del> take heed that it does not imbibe
<del>b</del> more,<del>thusly</del> but rather that it shows itself to
be very wet everywhere, without the water being imbibed in it. And,
removing it from the hot water, closed, cast your wax in such a state of
heat as has been said. And readily, neither the first nor second cast
come out until the mold is imbibed. Let it cool before opening it, in
order that the cast thing does not break. You will recognize that the
cast is good when the wax spilled out onto the outside of the mold is
thin and smooth. Remember to make many gates all along the mold, in
order that the wax run better thusly.</ab>

cast, your work becomes porous and does not come out neat,
<del><ill/></del>, it is all the same, for it is necessary that you
realise that the three of four first ones are not readily good. In the
first one, you recognize if there are some flashings, which keep from
releasing well and you remove them if they do not remove themselves at
the second or third first cast. And the more you cast, the neater you
will make it, and your mold will serve you for more than a hundred
times, if it is well overseen. But it is good to soak it one night ot
one day before casting in it, in order that it be well imbibed. The same
must be done for fruits of sugar. This wax is very <fr>doulce</fr> &amp;
amiable &amp; pliant as copper, and if it is strong because of the
sulphur, which renders it melted, far before the other, that you can
thusly prove on a hot slate. And the <m>sulfur</m> that you will have
put in it, will be found, the second time that you melt it, cracked at
the bottom. Having thusly passed through the wax, it does not inflame
from a candle. And on this occasion, <del>que</del> I think it will cast
very neatly for medals. One uses the same wax in place of varnish to
etch <ill/></ab>

When your animal is cast, cut with a hot penknife the flaws &amp;
superfluous things. And if you want to refold it &amp; twist it around
on some stick or taper, put it to soften <del>sur</del> in hot water,
and hold it while twisting it around.</ab>

Cut down the protuberance of the gates, in order that they are smooth
&amp; that the wax has more of the silver to run, in one go, without
turning around in the folds of the snake.</ab>
