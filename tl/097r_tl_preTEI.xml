<ab>One prepares the guards thoroughly with a soft, very <tl>soft file</tl> such that there is nothing black left on any of the guards, and next heat them, &amp; pass them as said. But to <m>gild</m> &amp; <m>gild</m> with <m>silver</m>, they ought not to pass, except maybe a little towards blue. Then while the guards are hot, one attaches them to a wood block &amp; with some tweezers one layers the gold &amp; one makes it sit with <m>bloodstone</m>,which is quite clean &amp; rubbed with <m><fr>pott√©e</fr></m>. And when the guards are cold, one reheats them, then one layers the <m>gold</m> as above. And first one gives <del><fr>de</fr></del> two layers, until the entire guard is well-adorned. And next one reheats as at the beginning, &amp; one gives the third covering of <m>gold</m>. Then one burnishes very thoroughly and with great force with a large <m>bloodstone</m>. <del>And</del> But note that <add>to</add> burnish well, the guard always needs to be warm. And to know this, one smells it &amp; brings it close to the nose. For one ought not to touch with the fingers, but one <del>grasps </del> picks it up from on top of the warm ashes with a small <m>iron</m> rod, which has been purposely made to go into the eye of the guard. And when it is entirely well-polished, one rubs it very well with a white <m>linen</m> cloth, and the <m>gold</m> needs to be thicker &amp; stronger than for <pro>painters</pro>. A quarter is worth fifty or LX s<exp>ols</exp>.</ab>

<head><m>Gilding</m> with <m>silver</m></head>


<ab>One needs to prepare the guards &amp; whiten them with a <del><fr>lince </fr></del> <m>file</m>, a little coarser <del>for</del> than for <m>gold</m>.  And one makes them pass to grey, as for <m>gilding</m>. And when they are warm, one needs to double the leaf of <m>silver</m>, then divide it with a knife, next cover the guard with it, with tweezers &amp; a small burnisher. And then reheat &amp; apply them, until they are all <m>gilded</m> in <m>silver</m>. Next one needs to cover them for the third time, with the leaf doubled as has been said, then burnish them very strongly &amp; with good strength, not with the <m>bloodstone</m>, but with a strong burnisher, just as the burnisher ought not to burnish <m>gold</m>.</ab>
