<head>Molding a <al>crayfish</al></head>

<ab><margin>top</margin>If some little thing is missing from it, you can
reattach it or else fill it with <m><pro>goldsmith</pro>'s
cement</m>.</ab>

<ab>The<al>crayfish</al> is one of the most fanciful to mold, but also
provides an example for casting many other very difficult things. Males
are distinguished by the eggs that females carry, and by the four
<del>legs</del> little white leglets at the back that males
<del>ap</del> have inside their tail, after the eight main legs. It is
only a good thing to dry them out a little, because the lumps only come
out <del>hard</del> rougher &amp; more beautiful, for everything that is
of shell does not diminish. It is true that if you let them dry too
much, these little inside leglets diminish &amp; rendered more slender
&amp; do not have as much body. If also they are too dry, the flesh
separates from the scales. Take heed, therefore, to use the average.
They have some hair between the legs &amp; at the end of the tail. And
because all hair is troublesome to mold, because it gets mixed up with
the sand &amp; is not released, you can burn it with a hot iron on the
<al>crayfish</al>, so that no one sees it. As for animals that have hair
or feathers, it is necessary that you smear them with <m>oil of olive,
of wheat</m>, which is quickly dry &amp; which will keep the hair flat
&amp; spread out. Thus, you will have the form of your animal and the
hair will also show, but made in waves, and this is something which can
be repaired. If your <al>crayfish</al> has eggs, which are delicate, and
which would be awkward to uncover without breaking, you would do better
to make the first cast on the belly &amp; eggs, in order that
<del>te</del> you only need to uncover the back, which is hard &amp;
easy to handle. And the belly &amp; the eggs will remain in the mold,
and one will need to burn them inside before opening your mold
<del>&amp; en</del> for the second time. Thus, <del>all</del> it will
open easily, for what is burned will no longer be attached. Thus, the
second cast, which is made on the first one, which has set well,
separates easily from the first, after having been reheated, which is a
singular secret for similar molds.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-top</margin>The gate is made by the tail, very
thin.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-top</margin>Do not forget to rub with eau-de-vie before
molding.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-top</margin><al>Stag beetles</al>, <al>crayfish</al>
&amp; <al>crabs</al> are molded in the same way.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>If your <al>crayfish</al> <del>a d</del>
has no eggs, mold the back on top &amp; the belly on the bottom. You can
give it some.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>It can be molded hollow as for the body,
but the legs cannot. And to do it well, <al>crayfish</al> are already
fanciful enough to mold without looking for the hollow, this ought to be
reserved for <al>turtles</al>.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>When you open your mold, you will find
the <al>crayfish</al> with white bones, but not in powder. And without
opening it, the <m><figure>â˜¿</figure></m> will have done nothing.</ab>

<ab><margin>bottom</margin>Layer these oily colors very
transparently.</ab>

<ab><margin>bottom</margin>To paint it, boil it with <m>wine</m> &amp; a
little <m>salt</m> in order that they become very red &amp; take this as
a model. Paint the back with <m><fr>vermeillon</fr></m> mixed with
<m>lake</m>, &amp; the sides &amp; underneath the belly &amp; the legs
with <m>vermeillon</m> &amp; <m>yellow ochre</m> and <m>white</m>.</ab>
