<head>Against burns, excellent</head>

<ab>Heat <m>linseed oil</m> on a gentle fire, without letting it boil
&amp; simmer, but once it is hot put in a quarter as much of the newest
<m>wax</m> you can. Once melted, let it cool, &amp; once they begin to
curdle, stir continuously with a new wooden spatula
<del><fr>t</fr></del> for as long as it takes you to say <del>one</del>
9 pater nosters, and as you say them, wash this composition with <m>holy
water</m>, stirring all the while. Having said the first 9 pater
nosters, pour out the first <m>water</m> &amp; put in new one, &amp;
wash &amp; stir the composition for the time it takes you to say 8 pater
nosters, and the 3rd time for as long as 7, &amp; and thus you will
consecutively <del>until</del> add new <m>water</m>, doing the same as
above, until the last &amp; single pater noster of nine. Then you shall
have a soft &amp; white ointment, with which you shall smear the burn
for the space of 9 days. But do not apply it any longer that this, for
it would cause your flesh to grow excessively. You <del>b</del> shall
bandage yourself twice a day, &amp; each time you shall wash your face
with water &amp; wine mixed together, a little tepid, not rubbing, but
as if pressing with wet <m>linen</m> cloth, and you shall wipe it
similarly <del><fr>aff</fr></del> with a fine <m>linen</m> cloth. &amp;
next put the ointment, over which you can put <m><pa>ivy</pa>
leaves</m>. This causes hair to regrow &amp; leaves no scar. A
<pro>gunpowder maker</pro> who had almost completely burnt himself
<del><fr>m’a</fr></del> &amp; showed no sign of the burn, taught me
this.</ab>

<head>Against dogs’ mange.</head>

<ab>The English, who caress their dogs a lot for taking care of their
livestock, have grooms for them, who <del>not</del> particularly hold
this office. And melting <m>pitch</m> in water &amp; leaving it to soak,
they rub the dogs with that water, or else with water of sublimate.</ab>
