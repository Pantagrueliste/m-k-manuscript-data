<head>Way to prepare <del>aspalt</del> spat</head>

<ab>It is found in earth in <pl>Germany</pl>, the color of cooked
plaster, made of long filaments, very soft to handle. And because it is
mixed with earth and filth, one pestles it roughly &amp;one makes little
balls, having, for this purpose, soaked it in <m>sal ammoniac</m>
<m>water</m> of such a composition that you were told above. One places
these balls to reheat in the fire of the furnace of the potters, then
one soaks it again in the same <m>water</m>. The earth and the
coarseness and go to the bottom, and the pure <m>aspalt</m>, which is
light &amp; soft and handleable as wet <m>flour</m>, adheres with the
<m>water</m> and goes to the surface, clouding the <m>water</m>, empty
that cloudy part in a separate receptacle. Having sat, one, one empties
the <m>water</m> by tilting, or by taking it away with a sponge, and the
pure<m>aspalt</m> remains at the bottom. Dry it &amp; employ it in
frame, having been moistened with <m>sal ammoniac</m> <m>water</m>. And
try it in the frame, in which it shrinks when reheated or dried, that is
to say that one needs to reheat it again on a good fire and redden it.
Thus, for medals and flat things, you should use this one, because it is
the most perfect of all for <m>gold</m>, <m>silver</m>, <m>copper</m>,
<m>lead</m>, <m>latten</m>, &amp; <m>tin</m>, for it withstands the fire
&amp; reddens whenever need be, without corrupting. The more it is used,
the <del>b</del> better it is, &amp; it does not spoil. At the beginning
it is white, &amp; being used it becomes grey. However make sure to put
aside the one that served for casting <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> &amp;
<m>latten</m>, for <m>gold</m> would sour in it, &amp; would not come
out of it well. And to do this better, you could put it aside to be used
for each metal. </ab>

It endures ten or twelve castings without corrupting, it withstands the
fire &amp; reddens, it is suitable for all metals. It is so tenacious
that should the frame be straked, it holds.

The <m>spat</m> almost does not set, even though it is reheated &amp; is
a kind of <m>plaster</m>. Raw, it breaks easily with the fingers.</ab>

<head>Excellent secret for molding hollow and very delicately in fine
<m>gold</m></head>

<ab>Cast with your aforementioned sand your animal and <al>lizard</al>
or other thing with <fr>argent de billon</fr> &amp; it will come out
very neat. <del>E</del> But take heed to mold it hollow, or at least
leave a small hole, in its mouth or in another place. Next, gild it with
fine <m>gold</m>, as uniform as it will be possible for you, three or
four or five times, &amp; until your <m>gold</m> has the thickness of a
piece of <m>paper</m> or something similar, &amp; all the scales will
always show equally. Next, put it in good <m>aquafortis</m>, which, by
this hole, will corrode the <fr>billon</fr> &amp; the <m>gold</m> will
remain hollow &amp; light &amp; wonderful.</ab>
