<ab>to cast, make him take through the mouth some good <m><fr>eau de
vye</fr></m> or else mix a bit with the <m>vinegar</m>. And soon it will
be dead, without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for
whom one would need a lot of <m><fr>eau de vye</fr></m>, one uses
<m>vinegar</m> and <m>urine</m>. But for small ones, only <m><fr>eau de
vye</fr></m>, which is done sooner. <lb/>

When your animal is dead, take it out &amp; clean it scrupulously of its
old skin, if it sheds, or of the filth, or of the lice, like
<al>lizards</al> have, and then apply thusly.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-top</margin>now put enough in a glass, &amp; soak there
&amp; keep there continually the head of the animal, or the whole of it,
if it is not big.</ab>

<head>Making the arrangement and disposition of the animal</head>

<ab>Having stocked up some fat <m>earth</m> called <m>clay</m>, that
should be grey, because that commonly the best, or another which has
good binding &amp; will should well prepared &amp; beaten, such that it
is handleable without attacking the hands nor the work, make a
<fr>lazagne</fr> or like a <fr>torteau</fr> of this <m>earth</m> equally
flattened with a round stick, which <pro>pastry-makers</pro> use, which
should be a little thicker than a <fr>poulce</fr>. And on this
<fr>tourtelle</fr>, arrange your animal, imitating its naturalness,
&amp; the way in which it is commonly shaped. And firstly, with a good
needle, pierce it from underneath, in the middle of the throat, &amp; up
to the top bone of the head. Retract the needle, &amp; in its place
&amp; its hole, put the point of an <m>iron</m> wire, of such a length
that it suffices to hold the head of the animal as high as it must be,
&amp; if the skin gets in to the inside<del>&amp;</del> when you put in
the point, pull it out with the edge of your small pincers, &amp;
arrange it as it was. Push the other end of the point in the
<fr>tourtelle</fr> of <m>clay</m>. Thus, the head will be held high,
which will have better grace &amp;once fixed, arrange after the gesture
of the body, &amp; the feet, &amp; the entanglement as you think will
look best. And so that it is secure &amp; does not move at all when you
throw in the sand, secure the legs with little points of <m>iron</m>
wire, having already made the first hole with a very sharp needle. Do
the same on the body parts that you deem necessary, making sure that the
points passing through the animal are fixed in the <fr>tourtelle</fr> of
earth, and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the
animal by a</ab>

<ab><margin>left-top</margin>Take a needle of fine <m>steel</m>, &amp;
which is the sharpest possible, so that with it, making the first hole
to place the points of iron, it passes without forcing anything, &amp;
by its harshness, does not push in or pull out the skin. Next, put in a
bigger point of iron in thick places, &amp; thin ones in thin places.
But head as a secret to not plant, in the first go, the point passed
through the animal in the plaster of earth, but having planted it, take
it out of the earth &amp; not out of the animal, &amp;next, fix it. This
is done because by fixing it the first time, it pushes in the skin of
the snake and by taking the point out, it replaces the skin in its
original state.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>When you put the points again you have
already used, clean them well of rust, so that they do not take away
some skin.</ab>

<ab><margin>bottom</margin>The main layout of your arrangement is to
place the head raised &amp; looking sideways. For this effect, pierce
the head on a solid plank or table <del>&amp; <ill/></del>, making the
point pass through the bottom of the throat, entering into the top of
the head
