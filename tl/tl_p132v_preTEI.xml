<ab>cool by itself. When it begins to redden, it is soon red everywhere.
But make sure, through the gate, that it is red at the bottom &amp; that
nothing appears black.</ab>

<ab>In a frame, if one casts hot, it becomes porous, therefore one only
needs to dry it out.</ab>

I have tried to make the molds, where it is mixed, not crack during
reheating, &amp; thusly not make flaws.</ab>

It is better made with <m>distilled vinegar</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Crocum ferri</m></head>

<ab>Having <del>d</del> passed it through vinegar &amp; reddened it in
the fire, I had it finely ground on the porphyry, until no roughness was
recognisable on the nail. Then, I wet it with very good vinegar, &amp;
<del>la</del><corr><del>u</corr>’y</del> left it two or three days,
stirring it several times each day. Finally I boiled it, &amp; reddened
<del>in</del> the pot &amp; crocum all together in the <fr>four à
vent</fr>. It came back in a mass full of small bubbles, but that can be
pulverized very finely between the fingers. I put some in the sand,
<del>a</del> half as much as alum de plume. I wet the sand quite thinly
&amp; molded out of it a very small lizard, which molded very neatly
&amp; delicately &amp; very finely. The crocum ferri did not render the
mold harder, but it firmed it. And when your mold is <fr>douls</fr>
&amp; fat, when scrapping it with a nail, it is a sign that the crocum
is good, very fine &amp; well prepared. The quantity cannot spoil the
mold, because it is a friend to gold. And I believe that silver would
come out well. And that the mold, through this means, does not crack.
Make it from fillings of needles.</ab>

One can put some amongst the molds, where you want to cast silver, for
it firms the molds, and you will find it so, by scrapping a little
harder than the other where there is none. It molds very neatly.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
This one is appropriate for all molds, &amp; keeps them from breaking
&amp; bursting in the fire. And for flat medals, it withstands several
casts. The one of steel fillings &amp; needles is redder &amp;
better.</ab>

<ab>You can gild them with amalgam, without spoiling any of the
features, if they are made of silver.</ab>
