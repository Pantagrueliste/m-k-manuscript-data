<head>Molding<al>turtles</al></head>

<ab>This is the continuation of the second preceding leaf. When you have
well uncovered the part of the belly of the <al>turtle</al>, the
underneath of the throat &amp; legs, &amp; having cleaned it all well,
do not forget to neatly uncover this cavity that these animals have in
their shell, between the neck &amp; the shoulders. Those of the water do
not have ones as deep as those of the <fr>garrigue</fr>, which are
leaner. And among these, there are some that have ones more ensconced
than others. Do not forget, therefore, to uncover well all of this to
best represent its nature. But if there is some cavity which twists too
much inside, and cannot be seen, does not release, put in some small
pieces of wax &amp; with points of thick hot iron wire, stretch &amp;
adapt the said wax. Then, <del>bouch</del> stuff with soft clay the
entrace of all its cavities. Put the clay circle around your mold, made
already of two pieces, which contains the back of the turtle. And to
mold its belly, one needs to divide in three, as you see. That is to
say, you will put a <fr>entredeulx</fr> of clay on top of the throat
&amp; another on the edge of the shell of the tail, <figure>#</figure>.
And having oiled <del>and</del> the shell of the belly &amp; having
rubbed it with eau-de-vie, cast your sand a little thick &amp; wet with
hot water as before. Having set, remove these <fr>entredeulx</fr> of
clay, then uncover well the front &amp; back legs, that is to say the
part underneath &amp; the tail &amp; the throat &amp; remove the cay
from the cavities <del>qu</del>, all in one piece if you can, for this
will show you if this cavity will release well. And if the pulled out
clay, brings with it the wax that you put there, reput it in the places
that can not release, as is said. And if some part is taken away or let
go, attach &amp; rejoin it to the mold with some wax &amp; the point of
hot iron. Do not forget to put some <del>po</del> melted wax at the end
of the nails of the turtles, to make the gate. Your molded and uncovered
belly shell, your mold can be seen thusly.<figure>#</figure></ab>

in such a way that only the entire belly shell be uncovered, to mold it
alone. </ab>
