<head>Excellent tempering for breastplates</head>

<ab>Take <m>river water</m>, as clear &amp; running as possible, &amp;
heat it to a little more than tepid. Then take a bunch of <m>weld</m>,
&amp; take the seed of it &amp; put it into the said <m>water</m> &amp;
boil it thoroughly, stirring it with a <m>stick</m>, then pour it into a
muid or any other vessel, then throw into it two pecks of <m>salt</m>.
</ab>

<ab>Then take a big cauldron full of the said <m>river water</m> &amp;
heat it up slightly more than warm. &amp; Take three or four times the
quantity of <m>red greasy earth</m>, three or four double handfuls, wet
it &amp; throw it into the cauldron with the said <m>water</m>. Take as
much <m>pigeon dung</m> as of the said <m>earth</m>, &amp; as much
<m>horse dung</m> &amp; as much <m>iron filings</m>. &amp; wet the whole
separately, &amp; throw it into the caldron &amp; leave it for two or
three days. Then throw it after into the said muid and stir the whole
thoroughly together. And the older this tempering liquid is, the better
it will be.</ab>

<head><m>Varnish</m> for <m>distemper</m></head>

<ab>You can make <m>marble</m> by <m>distemper</m> from <m>lake</m> or
<m>rose of <pl>Ghent</pl></m> &amp; <m>chalk</m>. Once dry, glaze with
<m>lake</m> mixed in <m>wine</m>, for the <m>glue</m> makes it die &amp;
blacken. And all will then appear red, but the <m>varnish</m> you will
put here, which will penetrate, will make dark &amp; light parts appear
as they ought to be. The <m>varnish</m> is made thus, mix with <m>clear
<pl>Venice</pl> turpentine</m> some <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m>
<del>&amp;</del> until all is clear &amp; liquid enough, &amp;it is done
without fire. This one <del><fr>es</fr></del> is for things in
<m>distemper</m>, and the <m>turpentine varnish</m> that you know, for
panels. <m>Pure <pa>spike lavender</pa> oil varnish</m> is not good for
panels, for <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> is too penetrating &amp;
makes colours sparkle, unless it was made long ago.</ab>
