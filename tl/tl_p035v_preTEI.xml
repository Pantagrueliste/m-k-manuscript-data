<ab>Take two small <m>wooden</m> bushels @of the same size, which should
be hollow on the bottom exterior by about the width of the back of a
knife or more. One of these will remain empty, &amp; on the bottom of
the other you will glue kernels of <m>grain</m> with <m>starch</m> so
that it will be covered entirely with <m>grain</m>, &amp; it will seem
to be filled with it. Take also a <m>wooden</m> bell into which you will
place as much grain as can be held within the capacity of one of the
bushels, and over the top put a simple piece of <m>leather</m> that fits
tightly inside the bell. Put all into a bag or a napkin or a folded
handkerchief, if you do not want to use a conjuror's pouch. First show
the empty bushel, then in front of the audience fill it with grain, then
put it back in the napkin. After, leave that one there &amp; take the
other where the grain is glued with starch &amp; it will seem to be the
first one, filled with grain. Put it under a hat &amp; place the bell on
the table, gently for the first time. And if you like, quickly &amp;
without stopping, show the bottom which will be covered with white
leather of the color of the wood. Then pretending to show the bushel
that is under the hat, you will turn it deftly to the side that is empty
&amp; leave it covered. Then you will command that by invisibilium the
grain pass into the bell, which you will have tapped shortly before on
the table a little strongly, &amp; the grain will fall to the bottom
&amp; cover the piece of leather. Then lift the hat; the bushel will be
found empty and the bell full of grain, which you will scrape deftly
along with the piece of leather
