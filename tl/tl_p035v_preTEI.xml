<ab>Take two <tl>small <m>wooden</m> bushels</tl> @of the <ms>same
size</ms>, which should be hollow on the bottom exterior by about the
<ms>width of the back of a <tl>knife</tl> or more</ms>. One of these
will remain empty, &amp; on the bottom of the other you will glue
<m>kernels of <pa>grain</pa></m> with <m>starch</m> so that it will be
covered entirely with <m><pa>grain</pa></m>, &amp; it will seem to be
filled with it. Take also a <tl><m>wooden</m> bell</tl> into which you
will place as much <m><pa>grain</pa></m> as can be held <ms>within the
capacity of one of the bushels</ms>, and over the top put a simple
<tl>piece of <m>leather</m></tl> that fits tightly inside the
<tl>bell</tl>. Put all into a <tl>bag</tl> or a <tl>napkin</tl> or a
<tl>folded handkerchief</tl>, if you do not want to use a
<tl><pro>conjuror</pro>â€™s pouch</tl>. First show the empty
<tl>bushel</tl>, then in front of the audience fill it with
    <m><pa>grain</pa></m>, then put it back in the <tl>napkin</tl>. After,
leave that one there &amp; take the other where the grain is glued with
starch &amp; it will seem to be the first one, filled with grain. Put it
under a hat &amp; place the bell on the table, gently for the first
time. And if you like, quickly &amp; without stopping, show the bottom
which will be covered with white leather of the color of the wood. Then
pretending to show the bushel that is under the hat, you will turn it
deftly to the side that is empty &amp; leave it covered. Then you will
command that by invisibilium the grain pass into the bell, which you
will have tapped shortly before on the table a little strongly, &amp;
the grain will fall to the bottom &amp; cover the piece of leather. Then
lift the hat; the bushel will be found empty and the bell full of grain,
which you will scrape deftly along with the piece of leather
