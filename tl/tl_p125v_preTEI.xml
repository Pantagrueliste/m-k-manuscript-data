<head>Vipers and snakes</head>

<ab>

I molded a viper, which, for casting, is more appropriate than any other
snake, because it has scales beautiful &amp; very visible on all the
body &amp; principally on the head and under the throat. It has a flat
head, the snout reddish, tending towards carnation, &amp; snubbed like
the horned aspic or like <del>un</del> the top of a pig's snout, big
jowls, the eyes very close to the snout, and the mouth wide open, where
it has double canine teeth on each side, all coming out of a strip of
flesh that covers and clothed them. It also has, in the throat, a tube
of flesh, made like a dog's penis, from which comes its stinger. Other
snakes have a double row of teeth.</ab>

If you want <del>cut</del> <del>the</del> to mold the snakes their
mouths open, you must cut off the head &amp; leave it inside, for it
will not be released.</ab>

<head>Molding turtles</head>

<ab>

It is a particular manner than the casting of snakes &amp; plants and
flowers, because the cavities that are between the two shells require
several pieces. They are molded in plaster to be cast in sugar without
making a gate, as do all other things, that you want.</ab>

<head><m>Plaster</m> for casting in <m>wax</m></head>

<ab>

When you want to cast in <m>wax</m> in the <m>plaster</m> mold, you must
know as secret that there is need for your mold to be in <m>hot
water</m>. Never does the animal come out so neatly than in metal,
because the wax sticks. But it is to model an animal as close to the
natural <del>et</del>, to then repair it. One needs to smooth well away
all the scales, <del>when</del> for wax would enter there, &amp; not
release well. In molding thus the animal, flatten down the scales for
wax, &amp;, on the contrary, rub them in reverse in order that they
stand up, for animals, for they will only be more visible. Also, do not
wait for the wax to cool completely to release it, but do so when it is
still a bit warm. When you have also molded the first cast of the
animal, uncover well the half, in order that, in its release, there is
as much of it in one half than in the other. Make also strong wide
gates, close to the animal, in order that it is fortified when it is
released, &amp; after, you cut that off.</ab>

<figure>+</figure> <m>Alabaster</m>, commonly called so, is nevertheless
plaster, is very hard, but it shrinks a lot. It is very good to make
medals, but it wants to be very finely sieved.</ab>
