<ab>from one leg to another, so that the spread out limbs are in
connection with one another due to the aforesaid casting conduits, which
you will start in the waxless round parts that you have put at the edge
of the legs to attract the metal. In this way, because you are casting
in <m>wax</m>, there is no danger chipping any part of the molded
animal. It's quicker to make the <m>wax</m> casting conduits thus,
because in this way <sup>you can</sup> cast the second mold after
<sup>the first</sup>, rather than wait to do them <sup>the
conduits</sup> after the mold has been recooked, because then, if
possible, you will need to have everything ready. You need to heat well,
and even redden the molds where there are <m>wax</m> conduits so that
they melt and leave nothing inside.</ab></div>

<head>Carcanets made <fr>Ã  jour</fr></head>

<ab>They are molded like <al>crayfish</al> in <fr>noyau</fr>, first with
one side being raised up with <m>clay</m> which is hollow, &amp; then
one uncovers them from the other side &amp; one makes the second
casting. They are also able to be cast well in <tl>frames</tl>, provided
that they are released easily. If they are not, one models them in
<m>wax</m>, or else one fills the cavities that were not able to release
with <m>wax</m> or <m>clay</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Iron</m> filings</head>

<ab>Because usually <m>filings</m> are mixed with nastiness, it is good
to redden them in fire to burn the impurities, and then wash them in
clear <m>water</m>. In this way, the dirt will go to the top of the
<m>water</m>, that you throw out, &amp; the good filings will go to the
bottom.</ab></div>

<head>Carnations</head>

<ab>Because the ones that are cast are usually massive, <del>ou bi</del>
they are weighty &amp; for this reason, one makes them with leaves &amp;
blades of silver.</ab></div>
