<head>Painting on <m>crystal</m> or <m>glass</m></head>

<ab>They paint in <m>oil</m> without lines, except for the faces where
they trace the nose &amp; the mouth with black in small work, then they
make strokes &amp; and highlights in white, next they coat all with
carnation. And as for the ground, they make it with <m>azur
dâ€™<pl>Acre</pl></m> for more beauty, or with <m>lake for a quickly-done
red</m>, or with <m><al>dragon</al>'s blood</m> for the most beauty. But
one needs to layer it little by little so that it appears even &amp; of
one color, &amp; thus for other colors. Next they put underneath it a
<m>leaf of <m>topaz</m>, or one of <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m></m>.</ab>

<head>Infusion of <m>anthos</m> or <m>rosemary</m></head>

<ab>In the month of August, the flower is better cooked &amp; more
suitable for making <m>oil</m>. Take of it whatever quantity you like
and put it into a bottle subsequently well stoppered, &amp; leave to
wilt in there in the shade for a day. Then put in it the first substance
of <m>wine</m> &amp; leave it to rest three or four days; and express
the whole into another vessel &amp; into this very same substance of
<m>wine</m>, put in seven or eight infusions of new flowers. Next, leave
the last infusion in the sun for a month. Next distil it through an
alembic. <del>Ne</del>, And take two ounces of this <m>water</m> in two
or three spoonfuls of <m>white wine</m>; but this is for the elderly.
Paul the Third used it.</ab>

<head>Cast</head>

<ab><m>Tin</m> comes out better being thin &amp; fine, rather than
thick, because being thick &amp; in great heat, it retracts. Therefore,
if you want to mold a thick piece in <m>tin</m>, mold it only on one
side, &amp; with a cavity on one side, if it is possible, in that way
you will have it more neat, and then you will be able to <m>solder</m>
two halves together. But if you have to mold it thick, make it in the
form &amp; mold a lot of <fr>abrevouers</fr> around the figure, in this
way.
