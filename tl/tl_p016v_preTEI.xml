<ab>which is usually of a height of <del><fr>d</fr></del> three
<fr><ms>pan</ms></fr>s <del>&amp; will reheat well the</del>. But first,
it is necessary that you have reheated your <tl>furnace</tl>
<del>with</del> with a little of the big <m>charcoal</m>, such that the
bottom is red hot and then you will put there the load of
<m>charcoal</m> in the middle of which you will put your <m>iron</m>,
not all at once but ten or fifteen <ms>lb.</ms>s each time. And when
this will be swallowed <del>&amp;</del> at the bottom of
the<tl>furnace</tl>, always put in as much again. And add three or four
<ms>shovel</ms>s of new <m>charcoal</m> which should be of the biggest
kind and moistened, in order that it may have more heat &amp; and not be
consumed to soon. And when you see that your <tl>furnace</tl> is full of
substance, around two <ms>quintal</ms>s, or less if you don't have that
much, you will leave the <m>charcoal</m> to be consumed by itself. And
when the <m>charcoal</m> is more or less reduced down to the level of
the <tl>furnace</tl>, you will be able to pour into molds &amp;
<m>iron</m> or <m>metal</m> shells, which is even better because one
<m>iron</m> attaches to the other. And it is necessary that the inside
of the mold be well covered with wetted <m>ashes</m>, in order that it
does not adhere to it.</ab>

<head>For removing fine hair from the <bp>forehead</bp></head>

<ab>Take a <tl><ms>needleâ€™s worth</ms> of <m>fine silk</m></tl> &amp;
pass it tightly across the places with the hair &amp; they will attach
to the <m>silk</m> like <m>fine cotton wisps</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Silk</m></head>

<ab><m>Crimson silk</m> is more frequent than all the other ones because
its colour is not as expensive as blue or green ones which are, also,
good bargain for the <pro>worker</pro>. <m>Black silk</m> is less
frequent because it costs a lot.</ab>

<ab>One needs to choose them quite whole, without being rotten, &amp;put

<head>Candles</head>

<ab>They can be kept in some <m>bran</m> which make them white and last
more, according to some. I believe, however, that it is enough to keep
them in a cool and dry place, so they are not pressed. It is better if
there is a <m>hemp</m> thread inside the wick of the candle to give more
light and maintain wick straighter. If it is otherwise all <m>cotton</m>
made, as those of <pl>Montauban</pl> do, it needs to be snuffed out
often because if it has been burning for a while, <m>cotton</m> falls
down and make the candle drip.</ab>
