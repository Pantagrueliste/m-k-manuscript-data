<ab>which is usually of 3 <fr><ms>pan</ms></fr>s high. But first of all,
you have to reheat your <tl>furnace</tl> with some big <m>charcoal</m>,
so the bottom is red hot and then you will put the said <m>charcoal</m>
measure in the middle of which you will put your <m>iron</m>, not at
once but ten or fifteen <ms>pound</ms>s each time. And since it will be
swallowed at the <tl>furnace</tl> bottom, keep putting some more. And
add three or four <ms>shovel</ms>s of bigger <m>charcoal</m> and avoid
it from getting consumed too quickly by wetting it. And when you will
see your <tl>furnace</tl> full of two <ms>quintal</ms>s of matter, or
less if you don't have that much, you will leave the <m>charcoal</m>
consume itself. And when the <m>charcoal</m> is almost dying at the
<tl>furnace</tl>'s level, you will be able to pour in the moulds and
<m>iron</m> or <m>metal</m> shells, which is even better for one
<m>metal</m> will bite the other. And the inside of the mold has to be
covered with soaked <m>ashes</m>, so it doesn't adhere to it.</ab>

<head>For removing fine hair from the <bp>forehead</bp></head>

<ab>Take a <tl><ms>needleâ€™s worth</ms> of <m>fine silk</m></tl> &amp;
pass it tightly across the places with the hair &amp; they will attach
to the <m>silk</m> like <m>fine cotton wisps</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Silk</m></head>

<ab><m>Crimson silk</m> is more frequent than all the other ones because
its colour is not as expensive as blue or green ones which are, also,
good bargain for the <pro>worker</pro>. <m>Black silk</m> is less
frequent because it costs a lot.</ab>

<head>Candles</head>

<ab>They can be kept in some <m>bran</m> which make them white and last
more, according to some. I believe, however, that it is enough to keep
them in a cool and dry place, so they are not pressed. It is better if
there is a <m>hemp</m> thread inside the wick of the candle to give more
light and maintain wick straighter. If it is otherwise all <m>cotton</m>
made, as those of <pl>Montauban</pl> do, it needs to be snuffed out
often because if it has been burning for a while, <m>cotton</m> falls
down and make the candle drip.</ab>
