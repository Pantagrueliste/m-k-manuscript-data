<head>Black color for dyeing </head>

<ab>Take <m>lye made from quicklime</m> and <m>white lead</m>, mix and
leave to soak and you will have a dark brown dye, and reiterating the
same you will make black. Try other colours with the <m>lye made of
lime</m>.</ab>

<head>Against nose bleeding and for dyeing</head>

that is red-veined, which is called <m><al>dragon</al>'s blood</m>, and
apply it on the bleeding person's forehead. This herb is a strong dye
&amp; makes beautiful violet.</ab>

<head>Beautiful artichokes</head>

<ab>One needs to cleanse them every year so that only one foot is left,
&amp; water them thoroughly. Also replant some every year, for the
second year they will bear very beautiful fruit.</ab>

<head>Planting trees </head>

<ab>One says that rarely a tree planted on Saint Paul's day needs to
take, &amp; for covering the bark, cow dung is very appropriate, for it
is not undone in the rain like earth.</ab>

<head>Merchants </head>

<ab>Those who retail velvet and other materials do not keep double-entry
books because they sell in small quantities and <sup>recording</sup>
these details would be too much effort. They only have their sales book
and account books. But those who sell in bulk and those who traffic in
woad have a double-entry book.</ab>

<head>Crimson</head>

<ab>Because one aulne costs seven or eight lb. to dye, they use
<sup>cloth</sup>worth seven or eight francs. But if one wants something
beautiful, one should buy some white cloth worth fifteen francs an aulne
and dye it with some pure crimson woad &amp; a little cochineal. Black
fabrics are very fine because the dye is inexpensive.</ab>
