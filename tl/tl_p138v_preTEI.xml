<head><m>Talcum</m> mixed in the molds</head>

<ab>I took the one from which I had pulled the <m>oil</m>. I crushed it
very finely even more <del>s</del> into a <m>steel</m> mortar with a
pestle, very lumpy like a file. I rendered it very fine &amp; in a
cottony &amp; downy powder. I mixed it with <m>sand</m> &amp; mixed it
together &amp; cast it in <fr>noyau</fr>. It molded <del>en no</del>
very neatly &amp; one ought not doubt that it holds in the fire.</ab>

<head><m>Gold</m> cast very thinly</head>

<ab>When goldsmiths have something to solder quickly and do not have
time to forge it, they melt some from gold, and then throw it on a cloth
or other things that withstand the fire, and they flatten it immediately
with a hammer or similar thing. And it ends up very thin &amp; even
receives the impression of the cloth.</ab>

<ab>Fine <m>gold</m>, not alloyed, can be cast for medals, but not for
plants &amp; lizards &amp; very fine things if it is not alloyed.</ab>

<ab>A <m>pansy</m> smeared with <m>wheat oil</m> can be cast in alloyed
<m>gold</m>.</ab>

<ab>And other thin <m>leaves</m>, but only if the branch is not too big,
and the leaves, especially, cast, can be soldered.</ab>

<head><m>Counterfeit diamonds put in a work</m></head>

<ab>Give a light coat on the inside of the setting with <m>black wax
</m>for <fr>esbaucher</fr>, then grease the inside, thus waxed, with
<m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m>, &amp; then powder this with <m>lamp smoke</m>
for it is necessary that <del><fr>ceste</fr></del> its color not have
luster for <m>false stones</m>. This done, set in your <m>stone</m>
<del>&amp; puys</del> with a bit of <m>wax</m>, then with a
<tl><m>steel</m> point</tl> &amp; a <tl>small finishing hammer</tl>,
join the edge of the setting to the <m>stone</m> in order that
<env>daylight</env> does not enter in. But keep from knocking the
<m>stone</m>, which would break.</ab>
