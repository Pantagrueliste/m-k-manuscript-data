<head><m>Talcum</m> mixed with the molds</head>

<ab>I used the one from which I had extracted the <m>oil</m>. I crushed
it very finely even more into a <m>steel</m> mortar with a pestle
<x>which was</x> rough like a file. I crushed it very finely into a
cottony, downy powder. I mixed it with the <m>sand</m> and soaked both
matters together, and I casted it en noyau. It molded very clean and
there is no doubt that it will withstand fire.</ab>

<head><m>Gold</m> casted very thinly</head>

<ab>When goldsmiths have to solder something quickly but don't have
enough time to forge it, they melt <m>gold</m> and then they pour it on
a cloth or on anything else that withstands fire. Then they flatten it
swiftly with a hammer or another similar tool, and it <x>the gold</x> is
very tenuous and it even retains the impression of the cloth.</ab>

<ab>Unalloyed pure <m>gold</m> can be cast into a medal but not into
herbs and lizards or other very delicate things if it is not
alloyed.</ab>

<ab>A <m>pansy</m> which is <m>oiled</m> with <m>wheat oil</m> can be
cast with alloyed <m>gold</m>.</ab>

<ab>And other fruit <m>leaves</m>, but with branch<x>es</x> that are not
large and especially the leaves, once cast, can be soldered.</ab>

<head>Counterfeit <m>diamonds put in a work</m></head>

<ab>Give a light coat on the inside of the setting with black wax for
<fr>esbaucher</fr>, then grease the inside, thus waxed, with <m>wheat
oil</m>, &amp; then powder this with <m>lamp smoke</m> for it is
necessary that its color not have luster for false stones. This done,
set in your stone with a bit of wax, then with a steel point &amp; a
small finishing hammer, join the edge of the setting to the stone in
order that daylight does not enter in. But keep from knocking the stone,
which would break.</ab>
