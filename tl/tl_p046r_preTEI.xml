<head>For the <bp>teeth</bp> <m>oil of sulfur</m></head>

<ab>Some people whiten them with confections of <m>aquafortis</m>,
however one says that this corrupts them afterwards &amp; causes a
blackness on them. One says that <m>oil of sulfur</m> is excellent, but
one needs to mix it in this way: take as much <m><pa>clove</pa> oil</m>
as can be held in a <ms><m>walnut</m> shell</ms>, and as much <m>rose
honey</m>, &amp; seven or eight <ms>drops</ms> of <m>oil of sulfur</m>,
&amp; mix it well all together. And after having cleaned the
<bp>teeth</bp> with a <tl>small burin</tl>, touch them lightly with a
<del>end</del> little <m>cotton</m> dipped in the aforesaid <m>oils</m>
and leave it for a little while, then spit or rinse your <bp>mouth</bp>
with <m>tepid water</m>, and reiterate two or three times. <m>Oil of
sulfur</m> penetrates &amp; is corrosive, <del>and the</del> but the
<m><pa>clove</pa> oil</m> &amp; the <m>rose honey</m> correct it.
Therefore use it with discretion.</ab>

<!-- we think this mark may be made by the oil of sulfur described in
p046v_4, and that this is the evidence of it bleeding through to the
other side of the folio. Or is this related to a compass mark? See also

over the space of four or five mornings cook one, and having mixed in it
a bit of powdered <m>gentian</m> and a drop of <m>oil of sulfur</m>,
give it to the patient. It is believed that the pain will not
return.</ab>
