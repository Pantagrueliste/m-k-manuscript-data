<head>Molding promptly and reducing a hollow to a relief</head>

<ab>You can imprint the relief of a medal in colored wax, &amp; you will
have a hollow, in which you can cast <fr>en noyau</fr> a relief of your
sand, on which you will make a hollow of lead or tin, in which you will
cast a wax relief. And then on that <m>wax</m> you will make your hollow
<fr>noyau</fr> mold, to cast in it the relief of <m>gold</m> &amp;
<m>silver</m> or any other metal you like. But to hasten your work if
you are in a hurry, make the first imprint &amp; hollow in <m>bread
pith</m>, prepared as you know, which will mold very neatly. And into
that, cast melted <m>wax</m>, which will give you a beautiful relief, on
which you will make your <fr>noyau</fr>.</ab>

<head>Very light and hollow work of <m>gold</m></head>

<ab>Cast a lizard or any medal you like in <m>base silver</m>, like
<m>billon</m>. Next gild it lightly. And once the first gilding is done
&amp; dried by fire, quicken, rub with a scratch-brush, &amp; make
another layer of light gilding like the first time, &amp; do thus three
or four times or more, according to the thickness you want to give. And
then, having made a small hole in the least visible place, put your work
into good <m>aquafortis</m>, which penetrating to the <m>silver</m>
through the hole will eat it all away without damaging the <m>gold</m>,
so that you will have a lizard hollow to its nails, or any other work,
so light that by blowing you will agitate it. But take heed not to make
the layer of <m>amalgamated gold</m> all at once, or of hardly any
thickness each time, because that would block the small features; but
proceeding therein as said, lightly &amp; several times, and cleaning
well, you will do fine.</ab>

In order for the aquafortis to eat away better, it is necessary to cast
in base silver.</ab>

<head>Chasing</head>

<ab><m>Lead</m> is so fat &amp; soft that one cannot strike it boldly,
&amp; one needs to have a very light hand. The other great metals are
easier. With a burin called <fr>onglet</fr> you make &amp; retrace the
more delicate lines, with the ordinary engraving burin the broader ones,
and with the <fr>chaple</fr>, you remove the big fins, and with the
chisels you soften the harshness of the lines, you smooth, you add
relief to a line.</ab>
