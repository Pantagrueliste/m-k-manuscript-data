<head>Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, {&amp;}c.</head>
 
<ab>Take <m><pa>linseed</pa> oil</m> or more cheaply, <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m>, and rid it of fattiness with <m><pa>garlic</pa></m> &amp; <del><m><pa>onions</pa></m></del> <add><m><pa>hog's fennel</pa></m> some also add <m>bread crusts</m</add>, which you will boil in it for a good quarter of an hour. Then add to one lb of the <m>oil</m> thus boiled a piece of <m>black pitch</m> the size of a walnut &amp; a <ms>double handful</ms> of <m><pa>wheat grain</pa></m>, without removing the <m><pa>garlic</pa></m> &amp; <m><pa>onions</pa></m> and let it boil together for a good quarter of an hour. And when the <m>pitch</m> is well melted &amp; the <m>oil</m> has body, you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your <m>iron</m> over a low <m>charcoal</m> fire &amp; apply your varnish with a <tl>feather</tl> or a <tl>brush</tl>. And when you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your varnish is dry.</ab>

For excellent black varnish, add two or three <m>paternoster beads</m> of <m>jet</m> among the rest.</ab>

Some consider <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> better.</ab>

If there is a lot of varnish, it needs to boil for at least half a day, for it is better the more it boils. It is dangerous if the fire catches within, if it goes over the top, and is hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a <env>courtyard</env> or an <env>open space</env>.</ab>


<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
In five or six lb of <m>oil</m>, one must put one lb of <m><fr>galipot</fr></m>, which costs 4 <fr>sols</fr>, &amp; some peeled <m><pa>garlic</pa> cloves</m>. This varnish itself is not black, but blackens over the fire.</ab>

<head>Black varnish without fire, without disassembling the harnesses or removing the bands from trunks</head>


<ab>Take varnish of <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> &amp; mix it with <m>soot black</m> or <m>lampblack</m>, &amp; without fire it will mix in by itself. Varnish with a brush &amp; it will soon be dry. <m>Turpentine</m> varnish will be quite good, but it does not dry as soon.</ab>

<head>Varnish of<pro>iron engravers</pro></head>


<ab>Take <m><pa>linseed</pa> oil</m> or <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> &amp;, in place of <m>black pitch</m>, you will put in a little <m>resin</m>, &amp; it needs to be cooked in the manner of <m>black varnish</m> on fire. And for applying it, heat your <m>iron</m> &amp; give it only one layer of varnish, &amp; when it no longer smokes, it is dry. Next engrave with a <tl><m>steel</m> point</tl> whatever you want. Next <add>take</add> <m>salt</m> &amp; <m>verdigris</m> &amp; soak as much of one as of the other in quite strong <m>vinegar</m> &amp; leave it for XX4 hours before using it, &amp; all will be soaked. Next spread some of this liqueur or sauce on the engraved object with a <tl>sponge</tl></ab>
