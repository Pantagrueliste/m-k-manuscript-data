<ab>Take white <m>pebbles</m> that are found by the rivers &amp; among
the sand bank, &amp; paths, which are somewhat transparent, &amp; if
they are perfectly <sup>transparent</sup> it will be better. If not use
the best &amp; whitest that you can. Calcine them three or 4 times in
your <tl><fr>four à vent</fr></tl> &amp; quench them in <m>water</m> or
<m>vinegar</m>. Next, take a <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of them and
pestle them in a totally pure <tl><m>copper</m> mortar</tl>, &amp; with
a <tl>pestle of pure <m>copper</m></tl>, and grind them until they
become very fine &amp; soft powder, and this is a sign that they have
taken the substance of<m>copper</m>, enough for giving them greenness.
At that time, on your <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of <m>pebbles</m>, put
in three <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of good <m>minium</m>, not
adulterated by <m>brick</m> &amp; anything else, and grind everything
together again very well in a <tl><m>bronze</m> mortar</tl>. And on all
of this, put in a <ms><fr>gros</fr></ms> of <m><fr>sel de
verre</fr></m>; &amp; some &amp; the common people put in
<m>sandever</m> that they find at the <pro>glassmakers</pro> or
<pro>apothecaries</pro>. But <m>alkali salt</m>, as you know, is better.

In this way, the common people make <m>emeralds</m> &amp; cast in sand.
If you do not have a <tl><m>bronze</m> mortar</tl>, grind in a
<tl>kettle of pure <m>copper</m></tl>.</ab>

One needs to reheat <tl>crucibles</tl> before putting in materials, and
put them in the <tl><fr>fornaise</fr></tl> or <fr><tl>four à
vent</tl></fr>, before making &amp; increasing the fire.

A <ms><fr>gros</fr></ms> of <m>salt</m> on the four
<figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of <m>pebbles</m> &amp;<m>minium</m>. When
one says: for <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure>, this is to be understood: on
one <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of the body &amp; not of the
<m>salts</m> &amp; the <m>minium</m>.

<head>For <m>ruby</m> take some <m>gold leaf</m></head>

<ab>Raise your <tl>furnace</tl> by two <tl>tiles</tl> all around,
because one needs more heat for making <m>rubies</m> than for
<m>emeralds</m>. And take one <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of white
calcined <m>pebbles</m> and put it in a <tl>mortar</tl> of <m>glass</m>;
&amp; having ground it coarsely with the <tl>pestle</tl> of the same,
mix in the weight of a <ms><fr>grain</fr></ms> of <m>gold leaf</m> of
what the <pro>painters</pro> gild, &amp; grind</ab>

<ab>

<margin>left-bottom</margin>

Some say that, mixing the <m>gold</m> with the <m>pebbles</m> and the
<m>saltpeter</m>, it makes the color of a <pa>peach tree</pa></ab>.

<ab>

<margin>left-bottom</margin>

Others say that it is necessary that the <m>gold</m> be soldered several
times then beaten into leaf.</ab>
