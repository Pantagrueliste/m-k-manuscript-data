The cannon fires at point blank from five to six hundred <ms>paces</ms>.
But not for breaching, for which good execution cannot be made except
from two hundred paces, or three hundred <del>paces</del> at the most,
and should not be any farther. Its shot usually weighs 40 <ms>lb</ms> of
the King's caliber. There is a fowler, which weighs xxv
<ms>quintals</ms>, which are small, short cannons. It is for fighting
the ditch casemates &amp; for battering at close range. It bears large
shot of the King's caliber like the others, namely of 40 <ms>lb</ms>. It
bears in the breech only the width of two balls &amp; a quarter of a
ball. The front only bears the width of one ball &amp; a third of a
ball. Its charge is similar to those of bigger one, namely xx
<ms>lb</ms>. And for this reason, when one wants to try them, one ought
not to over-charge it, for this damages the piece. And for the first
time &amp; until it has fired five or six <del>pieces</del> shots, it is
better not to give its complete charge, for the piece is unproven. And
the test that one can do is to give it a charge of xx <ms>lb.</ms> of
fine arquebus <m>powder</m> instead of ordinary cannon <m>powder</m>.
And four good <al>horses</al> are sufficient to carry it. They are easy,
&amp; close up they have as much force as the big ones, especially for
private houses &amp; small towns &amp; fortresses of little importance.
They are no more subject to bursting than the others because they are
short. For that which gives great strength to the <m>powder</m>m &amp;
to the piece the danger of bursting, is the length of the piece, because
the <m>powder</m> is burned entirely before exiting, &amp;
<del>the</del> its impetuosity is held constrained for longer in a
<del>small</del> long piece than a <del><fr>gr</fr></del> short one. The
fowler is usually seven to eight <fr><ms>pan</ms></fr>s long. It is true
that this is a <ms><fr>pan</fr> of <pl>Montpellier</pl></ms> &amp; not a
King’s <ms>pan</ms>, which is not used in the founding of guns for
making them good. For the <ms><fr>pan</fr> of <pl>Montpellier</pl></ms>
being <del>of</del> shorter, the cannons <del><fr>plus</fr></del>
proportioned there are shorter also, &amp;compensate in thickness
<del><fr>ce</fr></del> the length that they would have by the King’s
<ms><fr>pan</fr></ms>, by which measure they will be found longer. But
also they would be thinner. <del>The great cannons</del> The strength of
the fowler for making a breach is 80 <fr><ms>paces</ms></fr>.</ab>

The great cannon, because of the weight of its shot, carries a range of
only a thousand or xii hundred <ms>paces</ms> without landing,
&amp;bouncing, usually it bounces iii times.</ab>

The fowler does not have a large effect if not close.</ab>

One recognizes the good alloy of a piece by seeing it. For if, with the
greenness which they expel on the surface, they redden, that is to say
that they are composed of a sufficient quantity of <m>rosette</m>. If
not, they are only of <m>metal</m>, which shows up whitish. If they
themselves do not make this demonstration, scratch &amp; you will see.
</ab>

<ab>

<margin>left-bottom</margin>

The good alloy for pieces is of three <fr><ms>parts</ms></fr> of
<m>rosette</m> &amp; one of the fine <m>metal</m> from a big bell, where
there is more <m>rosette</m> than in the <m>metal</m> of small bells.
The <m>metal</m> usually costs xv <cn>lb</cn> &amp; fine <m>rosette</m>
xv or xvi.</ab>

The <ms><fr>pan</fr></ms> of <pl>Montpellier</pl> is equivalent to six
of <df><ms>the King’s inches</ms></df>, which contains in it two common.

It is necessary, for <del>a</del> mounting a piece well, that it be as
high at the side of the mouth as at the breech. Otherwise, one does not
mount well.
