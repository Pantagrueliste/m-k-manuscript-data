<head>Painting <m>metal</m> herbs</head>

<ab>If you are in a hurry it would be better to mix your color with a
not-too-thick <m>gum</m> <del>or</del> because <m>oil</m> takes a
<tmp>long time</tmp> to dry, and it runs if it is transparently layered,
as the herbs require. And if you still want it <add>done</add> quickly,
mix your color with <m>glair</m> beaten with <m><pa>fig tree</pa>
rind</m>, and your work will soon be dry. But layer it
transparently.</ab>

<head>For wormseed</head>

<ab> The pallid white of this herb is made from <m>green verditer</m>,
<m>white lead</m> or <m>ceruse</m>, a bit of <m>massicot</m>, <m>stil de
grain yellow</m>, and <m><fr>cendr√© d'azur</fr></m>. Mix &amp; compose
your color according to a natural branch that you will have. </ab>

<head><al>Viper color</al></head>

<ab>

It is the most beautiful <al>snake</al> that can be molded, because it
has very beautiful scales, &amp; hard &amp; transparent. Its true color
is made with good <m>verdigris</m>, well ground with some good
<m>vinegar</m>, if it is of <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>. And if it is in
some place darker, fumigate this first color with sulphur, as you know.
And if one needs to lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub with
a coarse linen. The male, ejects by its character which is at the base,
when it is tightly pressed, a little mass like a half ball of arquebus,
made in the genitals and full of very venomous spurs.</ab>

<head>Molded roses</head>

<ab>

They are awkward to mold because the leaves are very fine &amp; weak
&amp; doubled. But, to <del>obl</del> avoid this, one needs to smear
them with <m>wheat oil</m>, which is very dessicative. And having
quickly dried, it firms &amp; stiffens the leaves to be able to separate
them &amp; withstand the wet sand. The same is done with <al>flies</al>,
with pansies, &amp; similar delicate things, with flowers from the caper
plant.</ab>
