<head>Molding a cavity on one side and in relief on the other</head>


<ab>And for this effect, one casts a medal of fine <m>tin</m>, which is harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves it in one half of the frame, &amp; presses it a little so that it holds better. And next, you will cast in your frame some solder described above, or another more meltable than fine <m>tin</m>. And thus, the second medal will melt &amp; mold itself on the first one without spoiling it. But to make sure this is done right, mix some <m>lamp black</m> with <m>water</m>, &amp; with a <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>, give a light coat of this to the medal, which remains in the frame, &amp; leave to dry. Thus it will not melt.</ab>


<ab>But if you have a  medal of <m>copper</m> or <m>silver</m>, you can leave it in the cast, if you want to cast with <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>. But it is necessary that it be a little hot, for the cold would make the <m>tin</m> contract.</ab>


<ab><m>Tin</m> wants to be cast quite hot to come out neat.</ab>


<ab><m>Soft tin</m>, which is the best for the cast, is the one that, once cast <fr>en grille</fr>, is <del>burnished &amp;</del> shiny &amp; polished like a mirror, &amp; appears to have been burnished. And has have holes like the one that is brittle, &amp; that is not shiny, as if burnished.</ab>

<head><m>Potin</m></head>


<ab><m>Potin</m>, once cast hot, runs &amp; flows like <m>tin</m>. But the medal becomes whitish from this, and immediately pushes the <m><fr>verd</fr></m> to the surface, which good substances do not do.</ab>
