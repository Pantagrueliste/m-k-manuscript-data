<head><al>Small birds</al></head>

<ab><al><fr>Benarris</fr></al> sing at night if they are left in
<fr>serain</fr>, but they are better for fattening for fine tables than
for singing. <al>Chaffinches</al> are prone to becoming blind, &amp;
their eyes become swollen at the beginning of August.
<al>Goldfinches</al> like <m>lettuce seeds</m> very much , &amp; often
one catches them in gardens on seeded lettuces with two
<m>lime-twigs</m>. But because such regular <x>fare</x> would be too
expensive for them, they are ordinarily fed with <m>hemp-seed</m>. The
<al><fr>passe solitaire</fr></al> is cleansed with a <al>spider</al>,
which one needs to give to it once a week in order that it does not
become<fr>gaillardisse</fr>. The <al>calendra</al> is cleansed with
<m>dry mortar</m>, composed of <m>lime</m> &amp; sand for keeping it
from becoming <fr>gaillardise</fr> &amp; fattening too much. Young small
birds are cleansed with the same <m>dry mortar</m>, by putting some
pieces in their cages. The <al>cuckoo</al> lays in the nest of
<al><fr>benarris</fr></al> otherwise called <al>verdaule</al>. This bird
is very simple. I have heretofore given leave to two, which after
several days returned to their cage. For feeding young
<al>goldfinches</al>, one needs to pestle <m>almonds</m> with very small
<m>crumbs of the inside of a loaf of bread</m> and <m>lettuce seed</m>
or <m>hemp seed</m>. If it is for <al>linnet</al>, some
<m>rapeseed</m>.</ab></div>

<head>Curried <m>steel</m> and <tl>files</tl></head>

<ab>The <m>steel</m> that <pro>blacksmiths</pro> &amp; <pro><m>iron</m>
workers</pro> commonly use is not refined like that from
<pl>Germany</pl> or <pl>Biscay</pl>, which is reduced in hardness
<del><fr>p</fr></del> in a bath of a <m>molten iron</m>, but
<del>only</del> among the <m>iron bars</m> which are transported in flat
ingots from the <env>forges of <pl>Foix</pl></env> &amp; elsewhere,
there is a harder &amp; whiter &amp; finer kind than the other, as it
comes from the <env>mine</env>. And the <pro>workers</pro> choose it
&amp; use it like the other <m>steel</m>. And because it comes from
<m>common iron</m>, they call it <m>strong iron</m>. But it is not as
excellent as <m>purified steel</m> like that from <pl>Germany</pl> &amp;
<pl>Biscaye</pl>, which is sold in <ms>small beads</ms>. Some curry
<m>steel</m>, giving it a heating, then temper it <del>&amp;
<m>water</m></del> in a large quantity of <m>water</m>, then forge it.
&amp; <m>fine steel</m>, which is brittle, breaks and crumbles, &amp;
<m>iron</m> allows itself to be stretched. Thus they separate <m>the
finest steel</m> <del>&amp;</del>, which with another heating they
reduce to a mass. The <pl>Germans</pl> make their <tl>files</tl> from
<m>strong iron</m>.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>One applies <m>steel</m> to tools
<del><fr>dess</fr></del> not on both sides, but underneath the part
where one sharpens &amp; whets them. &amp; in this part, they must be of
<m>very <fr>doulx</fr> iron</m>.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin><pl>Levantines</pl> refine our
<m>steel</m> because their country does not provide them with any. And
they reheat it in a <tl>pot</tl> with <m>bitumen</m>, &amp;c.</ab></div>
