<ab>Two kinds are made in <pl>Toulouse</pl>, one to cover rooms' walls
which are finely woven, almost like <m>straw</m> hats worn by villagers,
and are made in long rolls, some 10 <m>straws</m> wide, others 13. And
they work on them mainly in summer and winter. Then when they prepare it
they sew it, but beforehand they dye it in usually three colours: green,
red and sometimes purple. The green one is made with only a <m>pastel
tincture</m> since green is made from yellow and blue, so the
<m>pastel</m> dyes the dark yellow <m>straw</m>. It becomes bright
green. For red they use some <m>alum</m> and <m>brazil wood</m>, for
purple they use <m>pastel</m> and some <m>coperous</m> which darkens
blue with its black tincture.</ab>

<ab>They have no invention for making a perfect red in a work, so that
one needs to reheat it. However try the <m><df><pl>German</pl>
red</df></m>, which is <fr>rouge d'escaille</fr>. They make their common
red with some <m>sanguine</m>, <m>looking-glass tin</m>, <m>rock
pieces</m>, <m>litharge</m> &amp; a bit of <m>scales of iron</m>. The
said red saturates one side &amp; the other of the <m>glass</m> in order
that it has more color, if it saturated only one side it would be very
pale orange.</ab>

<ab>They pay xx <cn>lb</cn> for a <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>rosette</m>,
which is harder to melt than <m>latten</m> because it is softer. For,
the softer the <m><add>great</add> metals</m>
<add><figure>#</figure></add> are, the <del>soft</del> harder they are
to melt. The <m>tin used to make bells</m>, which is <m>fine tin</m>
<del>is more</del> and which is brittle, is easier to melt than <m>lead,
which is soft</m>. <m>Latten, made brittle by the <m>calamine</m></m> is
melted more quickly than <m>red copper</m>. The <m>metal, which is the
substance of bells</m>, mixed with <m>tin</m>, and very brittle, is soon
melted. The more <m>silver</m> is alloyed, the sooner it melts, that is
why <m>solder</m> is made with it. In <pl>Germany</pl> they make very
light candlesticks, it is because they turn them by means of
<m>water</m>, but they are breakable. A <ms>quintal</ms> of
<del><fr>per</fr></del> <m>fine <pro>coppersmith</pro>'s rosette</m> is
sold for xxx or 40 <cn>lb</cn>. Another type used by <pro>founders</pro>
is sold for xii or xv <cn>lb</cn>. The <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>metal</m>,
six <cn>lb</cn>.<del>Put in</del></ab>
