Recuire,,1,"to tranform again by the action of heat. In f.111r, the author defines ""recuire"" as the process of turning a mold red for the second time (“Faire pour la seconde fois rougir”). He contrasts this process to drying (“desseicher”) metals. Similarly, on a margin note of f.118v, “recuire” is defined as “turning a frame red,” a process similar to what “is done for gold and silver.”",,,v.,,,,,111r | 118v,,,,,,,,
Recuire,,2,"While the a-p aften uses “recuire” in its generic meaning (i.e., to put again something to the fire), the 9th edition of the DAF specifies that the verb is also employed in many arts to designate a specific heating treatment which craftsmen use in order to “perfect their craft” or “make it more durable.” Goldsmiths, for example, restitute the desired malleability and ductility of their objects by reheating or annealing them. Glassblowers use a special furnace to reheat the glass lest it shatters. This process can be translated in English as “annealing” or “tempering,” according to the context. (See Ashbee’s translations of “ricuocere” in Benevenuto Cellini’s Two Treatises.)",,,v.,DAF | Cellini,,,,,,,,,,,,
