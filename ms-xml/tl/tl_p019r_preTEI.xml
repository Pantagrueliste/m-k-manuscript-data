The <wp>falconet</wp> is loaded with a <tl>ladle</tl>, and one
commonly gives it only one <tl><ms>ladle</ms></tl>. There are also
other falconets weighing three <ms>quintals</ms>, and which
are nine <ms><fr>pans</fr></ms> long. Their ball weighs half a
<ms>lb</ms>. Their charge is a quarter of <m>powder</m>. It is loaded
either with a <tl>ladle</tl>, but more commonly with a charge. <ms>At the
breech, 3 balls, &amp; 2 in front</ms>. To the small <wp>pieces</wp> which
are under 3 <ms>quintals</ms> one gives them at least <ms>3 balls
&amp; a twelfth part of a ball</ms> at the breech, &amp; sometimes
takes away from the front to make this addition to the breech, according
to the length one gives them.</ab>

The strength of the <wp>piece</wp> is at the level of the trunnion, which is the
point of departure of the lit <m>powder</m>.</ab>

The strength of the <fr>berche</fr> is at the

breech.

A <wp>double musket</wp> weighs 2 <ms>quintal</ms>s, is seven
<fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long, carries a ball of a quarter of a

<ms>lb</ms> or a little less. <ms>At the breech 3 <ms>balls</ms>, two in
front</ms>. One loads it with as much <m>powder</m> as <ms>ball</ms>, <ms>up to the top of
the escutcheon</ms>,<comment>c_018v_02</comment> which in these <wp>small pieces</wp> can amount to <add>3

or</add> 4 <ms>balls</ms> of <m><wp>arquebus</wp> powder</m>. For if one uses
<m><wp>cannon</wp> powder</m>, one can load it to a <ms>thickness of <del>f</del>
five balls</ms>.</ab>

One needs to understand all of this as <m>iron</m> balls. When one
shoots a <m>metal</m> ball, one over-charges by a quarter
<tl><ms>ladle</ms></tl> because if a <wp>cannon</wp> ball weighs 40
<ms>lb</ms>, the <m>metal</m> one weighs lx <ms>lb</ms>. One also takes
the gun-sight higher when shooting a <m>metal</m> ball. For if one
shoots an <m>iron</m> ball point-blank, one takes six <ms>lines</ms>
higher when shooting <m>metal</m> balls. A <m>metal</m> ball <del>makes</del>
alloyed with <m>copper</m>, in order that it is not frangible, is more
effective hitting at close range than that of <m>iron</m>. But the
<m>iron</m> one hits more fiercely from afar. </ab>

<ab>

A <wp>simple musket</wp> weighs one <ms>quintal</ms>, is six
<fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. <del>carries a ball weighing <ill/>
<fr>qu</fr></del> One has no consideration for those which are under two
<ms>quintal</ms>s, which readily carry <m>lead</m> balls
<del><fr>un</fr></del> of the weight of the ball, but of the caliber.
However, those which can receive balls of <m>metal</m> or <m>iron</m> do
better because they will penetrate more than six <m>lead</m> ones. Its
charge is <ms>up to the escutcheon</ms>, namely the <ms>thickness of 4
balls</ms>. </ab>

<ab>

<fr><wp>Arquebus à croc<wp><fr> weighs lx <ms>lb</ms>, that is to say the large one is
five <fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long, its charge is <ms>up to the
escutcheon</ms>, namely <ms><add>the length of</add> 4 balls</ms>, it

carries <m>lead</m> balls, and is for the defence of houses. Of these
<fr><wp>arquebus à croc</wp><fr>, both the large &amp; the small ones, one makes <wp>orgues</wp>
which are <del>or</del> appropriate for an assault, both outside &amp;
inside the place. They are founded separately as if to serve for uses
other than <wp>orgues</wp>. See the marked 4th leaf following.
