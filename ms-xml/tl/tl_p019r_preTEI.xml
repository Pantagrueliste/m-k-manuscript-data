The <fr>faulconneau</fr> is loaded with a <tl>linstock</tl>, and one
commonly gives it only one linstock. There are also other
<fr>faulconneaux</fr> weighing three <fr><ms>quintals</ms></fr>, and
which are nine <fr><ms>pans</ms></fr> long. Their ball weighs half a lb.
Their charge is a quarter of <m>powder</m>. It is loaded either with a
<tl>linstock</tl>, but more commonly with a charge. At the breech, 3
balls, &amp; two in front. To the small pieces which are under three
<fr><ms>quintals</ms></fr> one gives them at least three balls &amp; a
twelfth of a ball at the breech, &amp; sometimes takes away from the
front to make this addition to the breech, according to the length one
gives them.</ab>

The strength of the piece is at the level of the trunnion, which is the
point of departure of the lit <m>powder</m>.</ab>

The strength of the <fr>berche</fr> is at the
<fr>maslée</fr><comment>c_019r_01</comment>, &amp;at the back of the
breech.

A double musket weighs 2 <fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr>, is seven
<fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long, carries a ball of a quarter of a pound or a
little less. At the breech 3 balls, two in front. One loads it with as
much <m>powder</m> as ball, up to the top of the <fr>escusson</fr>,
which in these small pieces can amount to <add>3 or</add> 4 balls
arquebus <m>powder</m>. For if one uses cannon <m>powder</m>, one can
load it to a thickness of <del>f</del> five balls.</ab>

One needs to understand all of this as <m>iron</m> balls. When one
shoots a metal ball is, one over-charges by a quarter
<tl><ms>linstock</ms></tl> because if a cannon ball weighs 40
<ms>lb,</ms> the metal one weighs lx <ms>lb.</ms> One also takes the
gun-sight higher when shooting a metal ball. For if one shoots an
<m>iron</m> ball point-blank, one takes six lines higher shooting metal
balls. A metal ball <del>makes</del> alloyed with <m>copper</m>, in
order that it not be frangible, is more effective hitting at close range
than that of <m>iron</m>. But the <m>iron</m> one hits more fiercely
from afar. </ab>

<ab>

A simple musket weighs one <fr><ms>quintal</ms></fr>, is six
<fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. <del>carries a ball weighing <ill/>
<fr>qu</fr></del> One has no consideration for those which are under two
<fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr>, which readily carry lead balls
<del><fr>un</fr></del> of the weight of the ball, but of the caliber.
However, those which can receive balls of metal or <m>iron</m> do better
because they will penetrate more than six <m>lead</m> ones. Its charge
is up to the <fr>escusson</fr>, namely the thickness of 4 balls. </ab>

<ab>

Arquebus à croc weighs lx <ms>lb</ms>, that is to say the large one is
five <fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long, its charge is up to the
<fr>escusson</fr>, namely <add>the length of</add> 4 balls, it carries
<m>lead</m> balls, and is for the defence of houses. Of these arquebus à
croc, both the large &amp; the small ones, one makes orgues which are
<del>or</del> appropriate for an assault, both outside &amp; inside.
They are founded separately as if to serve for uses other than orgues.
