<head>Stance of animals</head>

<ab>Not only with iron points, but with melted wax, animals are secured
on the slab of earth. Wash them first in clear water, once dead in the
mixture of vinegar &amp; urine, &amp; with a sponge cleanse their mouth,
eyes and head of the slime which comes out, for the sand would never set
well there and would become lumpy.</ab>

If you want to make them keep their mouths open, put in a little bit of
spinet string, which will not take up space.</ab>

<head>Keeping animals</head>

<ab>Having molded them once, if you want to keep them for molding again,
put them back into the mixture of urine, vinegar &amp; spirits where you
killed the others, and they will keep for a long time without decaying.
If you have a cut on your hand, take care that this mixture does not
touch it.</ab>

<head>Molds</head>

<ab>Once molded, do not keep them for a long time, but rather use them
<del>u</del> as soon as you can, because when kept a long time, they are
subject to corrupting.</ab>

<ab>When they are reheated, the thing comes out better.</ab>

<head>Lute</head>

<ab>When reheating, you can use common lute. But when you want to cast,
strip it from the mold &amp; promptly, with a brush, layer the plaster
lute that has been used for molds, for it will be dry when it is placed
&amp; cast. One needs to mainly put this lute on the joints.</ab>

<head>Silver</head>

<ab>When it quivers, once melted, it is a sign that it is well hot &amp;
because usually it is leady, it is good to throw in it some lime mortar,
for this attracts &amp; gathers the lead.</ab>

<head>Fly wings</head>

<ab>In order that they come out better, put from the gate to the edges
of these some veins of wax. Make sure also that under the belly there is
enough wax, for this is what makes the gate.</ab>

<head>Joining some fly wings, or similar</head>

<ab>They are joined with fish glue mixed with eau-de-vie over slow fire,
heating also the work. Then this is covered with modelling wax, which is
grey.</ab>
