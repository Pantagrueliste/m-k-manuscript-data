<ab>Or to be safer, retire from there until the fire has died down &amp;
all is cooled, <del><fr>Ap</fr></del> for its exhalation would be
dangerous. And for the occasion when you
feed<comment>c_052v_01</comment> it with pincers, <del><fr>b</fr></del>
wash your mouth with good <m>vinegar</m> &amp; take some preservative
&amp; plug yourself up well. Once dead, put it in a cloth or a canvas of
<m>silk</m> &amp; fold it &amp; hang it from the ceiling, where the air
<del><add>or</add></del> &amp; sun dry it. Once quite dry, pulverize it
in a mortar. And keep this powder carefully, because one ℥ of this
thrown on iii lb of molten <m>♁</m> reduces it to finer <m>☉</m> than
the other one. But it does not have as much <comment>c_052v_02</comment>
weight. For this work you also need to choose the oldest <m>♁</m> that
you can, which has often been melted &amp; finely hammered into sheets
or other works, &amp; purify it before by melting &amp; throwing it into
<m>honey</m> &amp; <m>vinegar</m>. The term of the work is nine months
from the feast of Saint John until the 25th of April. </ab></div>

<ab>Who wants to have it beautiful &amp; <del><fr>p</fr></del> very
delicate, one needs to pick it before the <del><fr>f<ill/>d</fr></del>
seed may be perfectly ripe. For if one waits for the seed to be
perfectly ripe, the foot is so dried by the sun that it is brittle &amp;
breakable. It is true that in this way the seed is reduced by a
third.</ab>

<head>Colors</head>

<ab>If you want to keep them beautiful in <m>gum</m> and such that they
do not lose any of their natural color, put <m>white wine</m>, the
whitest and clearest you can, in a <tl>bottle</tl> with a little
<m>tragacanth gum</m>. And having <tl>stoppered</tl> the
<tl>bottle</tl>, scramble &amp; shake it very strongly together, &amp;
let it rest until the <m>tragacanth</m> is dissolved. Also put in a
little fine-grained <m><fr>sel blanc</fr></m> to brighten the whole.
Some mix <m>clear water</m> with <m>white wine</m>, and with this
mixture they temper the colors without grinding. And these show very
beautifully on <pro>illumination</pro> works.</ab></div>
