<head>Moulding <al>turtles</al></head>

<ab>The water <al>turtle</al> is more beautiful to mold because it has
prettier scales &amp; straight legs. And those of the <fr>garrigue</fr>
have crooked ones. They are long living, getting ready to kill them,
open their mouth &amp; pass a long penknife through all the intestines,
&amp; then make it swallow some <m>vinegar</m> mixed with
<m>eau-de-vie</m> or <m>urine</m>, as for snakes. One needs to mold them
in several pieces, &amp; the back itself sometimes, because the sides
for some are more narrow than elsewhere &amp; are not released on this
occasion. To make them die, one ought not boil them, for they come apart
&amp; even the shell, from the hot <m>water</m>. They come out better
hollow, because their great thickness corrupts the mold. Those from
water are more vigorous. Those from <fr>garrigue</fr> are thinner,
slower, &amp; more sleepy. If you scratch those of the water on their
shells, however sleepy they are, they move. Those from <fr>garrigue</fr>
do not.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-top</margin>They die rather quickly in <m>vinegar</m>
mixed with a little <m>eau-de-vie</m> or <m>urine</m>, as with all other
animals.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-top</margin>They keep themselves, in the winter, with
their eyes closed &amp; are as dead, being numbed by the cold. They hide
in the earth or under chaff or warm manure, &amp; live only on the
moisture of the <m>earth</m>.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>@One ought not to mold them as soon they
die because they are still too stiff. But on the next day, you will
manipulate them &amp; fold their legs as you wish.</ab>

<ab>Those who mould <fr>de travers</fr> make their sand with
<m>crocum</m> &amp; <m>calcined slate</m>, but <m>slate</m> always
retains its asperity &amp; becomes porous, because it is a fat. In the
<fr>noyau</fr>, it is not good, in sand, it can be accomodated. They
sieve their sand, grind it on <m>porphyry</m>, and wet it in
<m>water</m>, &amp; they take away the finest, which is on top, then
reheat it.</ab>

<ab>Once molded, it can be removed without burning it, because it
releases well. Choose the biggest &amp; the lumpiest. Because they
contain a lot of metal, it is best to mold them hollow, for they come
out better. You could make your cast in one piece &amp; large, but it
<del>s</del> would be awkward to cut. It is best to do it in three or 4
parts, which are a little wide close to the animal, &amp; include the
most of the edge of this, which is close to the gate, that can be done.
Make also some gate conduits from the end of </ab>

Let the mold cool before opening it, especially for thick things.</ab>
