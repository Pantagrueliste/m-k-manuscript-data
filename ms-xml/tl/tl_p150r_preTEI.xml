<head>Molds</head>

<ab>They are less subject to cleaving while reheating when they are very
thick, rather than when they are of a little thickness, provided that
the thickness is sufficient. For when thin, they scarcely need to be
<del>rehea</del> on the fire, &amp; a long time on the fire makes them
corrupt, especially when the <m>plaster</m> is not strong.</ab>

<ab>It is better to reheat a mold on its own than several together,
because one needs a larger &amp; more violent fire for several than for
one. And, glowing <m>charcoal</m> stopping up the space between the
molds, the heat reverberates from one to the other in such a way that
more often you will find your molds burst &amp; cleaved open on one side
more than another.</ab>

<ab>Therefore reheat your molds alone, not making fire there, except to
cover it.</ab>

<ab>And because your <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m> become sour when
frequently melted red, to soften it melt it without reddening it and
cast in a rod.</ab>

<ab>Brick cools the <m>metal</m>, &amp; if this was for giving a bond,
it will not be necessary.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>

The reheated molds cannot withstand several casts. But those in which
one wants to cast only <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>
<corr><del>and</del></corr> <add>or</add> flat medals, having been only
dried, withstand many.</ab>

Very finely ground <m>iron scales</m> render them very firm &amp;
strong.</ab></div>.
