<head>For bringing a <wp>cannon</wp> over <env>land</env></head>

<ab>

<del>If you have</del> To bring a <wp>cannon</wp>, one needs a hundred
<pro>pioneers</pro> or more to flatten the tracks by levelling ditches
&amp; others obstacles, such as <pa>trees</pa>, <m>stone</m> mounds
&amp; similar things to make gabions on the way. Once one is close to
the place one wants to batter, the <pro>gunner</pro> goes <tmp>at
night</tmp> to reconnoiter the most convenient place to mount the
battery &amp; if he does not see well, one gives a false alarm in order
that those on the inside throw <wp>torches</wp>. Very often, one batters where it
is strongest because the assailed, disdaining the battery, do not make repairs there.
Commonly, there are not many garrets &amp; other defenses in
that place. And when one has made a breach at the strongest part &amp; the
<wp>cannon</wp> removed, it will surprise the assailed. One approaches
<env>fortified towns</env> <tmp>at night</tmp>, but to <env>poorly
fortified towns</env>, <pro>pioneers</pro> bring gabions and
<del>carry</del> once these are placed, one puts some boards or planks
behind the gabions to keep the <pro>pioneers</pro> safe, while behind,
they fill the gabions with some <m>earth</m> by means of their
<tl>shovels</tl>. And while one does this, one raises some false alarm
on another side. And before, one has fired a volley at the defenses.
<corr><del>The gabions</del></corr> The <pro>pioneers</pro> carry the
boards to make a level ground or a platform of four
<bp><ms>fingers</ms></bp> or half a <bp><ms>foot</ms></bp> thick, and
one sets them into the <m>earth</m>. The platform is five or six
<del><wp>canno</wp></del> <bp><ms>feet</ms></bp> larger than the <wp>cannon</wp>â€™s wheels
on each side <del><fr>m</fr></del> if there is only one <wp>cannon</wp>. But if
there are more, the platforms touch. The distance which is between the
pieces is the <ms>width of two gabions</ms>. As long as the battery
lasts, the <pro>gunner</pro>s sleep &amp; eat close to a <wp>cannon</wp>. In
small spaces, one does not bother to dig trenches to reach the pieces
but one puts plenty of gabions that are high and goes running to them. In large
places one digs trenches. There are always in trenches or behind
barricades <del>some</del> companions-in-arms on guard duty to defend
the pieces. One keeps the small <m>powder</m> magazine, of three or four
<ms>kegs</ms>, separately,</ab>

It is good if the platform is slightly inclined toward the front because
the <wp>piece</wp> is more quickly mounted for battery &amp; holds the blast
better &amp; batters more fiercely.</ab>

<head>Fowlers</head>

reinforcement inside, in the entire space which contains the <m>powder</m>, and the
ball can only <del><fr>a</fr></del> roll up to the opening of the said
chamber. These do not penetrate so much &amp; are irritating to load but
they do not heat up as quickly.</ab></div>

<head><m>A steel</m> touch-hole</head>
<ab margin="left-middle">is
put in the <wp>cannons</wp> in the manner of a screw so it will not be damaged

are prone to blow off &amp; cause damage to the <pro>gunner</pro>. There
is nothing for it but to use a proper touch-hole.</ab></div>
