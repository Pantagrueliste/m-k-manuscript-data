<ab>Sometimes they are fattened &amp; by means of the <m>fat</m>, the
<m>lead</m>, which is fatty in itself, or other <m>filings</m>, attach
to it. And you will be able to clean them either with <m>hot
charcoal</m> or a <tl>wire brush made of <m>wires of
latten.</m></tl></ab>

<ab>It is molded like the rose, marigold, &amp; all other flowers, thus
as is said, namely, the flower in one whole mold, &amp; all the leaves,
if you want, in two halves, joining them by solder for a more assured
way, even if you could mold them together in a closed mold. I cast one
that came out very well. But it is necessary that the the <m>sand</m> be
very thin &amp; blown thoroughly.</ab>

<head>Molds</head>

<ab>Make the two sides so that they are, <del>es</del> if it is
possible, one as thick <del>seur</del> as the other, in order that they
can be quite evenly reheated. When you mold some animal that should be
burned <del>you</del>, like crayfish, you cannot open it to clean it
&amp; make the cast so that it is not reheated. And when they are
reheated one time, keep them scarcely at all without casting, for they
are rendered musty &amp; moist, &amp; the mold is undone &amp; loses its
strength.</ab>

The part where the back of the animal is, is usually thicker.</ab>

<head><m>Plaster</m> alone</head>

<ab><m>Plaster</m> reheated on stone <del>fears</del> is undone in
<m>water</m>, but that which is <del>reheated &amp;</del> first
pulverized and then reheated does not fear it. But if it is good it
hardens in it, like those of Paris &amp; Spain, which is hard on stone,
as is that which grows in lean &amp; dry earth and which seems like
white salt. Germans make statues for their fountains with it, which are
not spoiled, especially once varnished, but it is hardened in
<m>water</m>. When it is alone &amp; not mixed, it took hold more
quickly than otherwise. One needs to oil very lightly your molds that
are of metal or stone, otherwise it will not release. And however you
oil, one needs to wet it with hot <m>water</m>. And when it will have
taken hold &amp; is well cooled, one needs to wet it sometimes in cold
<m>water</m>, but if it refuses to open, in hot water &amp; sometimes in
boiling <m>water</m>.</ab>

<ab>

<margin>left-bottom</margin>

Sometimes one even needs to make the mold boil in hot <m>water</m>, as
when you have molded some <m>wax</m> that you fear would not be easily
released from it.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>

Cold water makes oil withdraw to the surface of the plaster that has
sucked it in, &amp; thus it released.</ab>
