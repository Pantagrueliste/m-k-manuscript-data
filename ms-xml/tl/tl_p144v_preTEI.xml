<ab>having been thusly arranged &amp; well cleaned with brushes, place
<del>la</del> the circle of <m>clay</m> around the slab. Then, with a
band of <m>clay</m> placed on the middle of <del>e</del> the
<del>la</del> back of the <al>turtle</al>, as you see, &amp; at the
widest place, divide your mold. Subsequently, <m>oil</m> with your
<m><fr>pinceau</fr></m>, dedicated for this, the half of the shell you
want to mold. Wet in hot water, so that without burning yourself, you
can hold your finger in it without burning, your <del>p</del> sand, a
little thick. And <del>f</del> before throwing it, rub the shell with
<m>eau-de-vie</m>. And next, cast your sand &amp; let it set and note
that all things that have shells, or that are hard, or are not
malleable, like <al>snakes</al> and <al>lizards</al>, want to be
<m>oiled</m> to release. Things that are malleable do not need this.
<m>Hot water</m> makes the wet sand <del>in <m>water</m></del> set
better on <m>oil</m>, which otherwise would be refused. Your half of the
turtle, having thusly <del>desp</del> been molded, separate it with its
half mold, from the clay slab, that you will set aside to return it to
when it is necessary. Next, clean your half mold &amp; smooth it &amp;
flatten, like the others. But because it happens that because
<del>u</del> of the clay <fr>entredeux</fr>, the half mold will consist
of more than half of the turtle, cut &amp; pair down smoothly the
excess, &amp; clean everything well with brushes. Then, make on the top
edge of the mold, on the side that is cut &amp; halfway, two notches,
like for other molds and return your turtle to its slab, as it was &amp;
secure its two legs, which are not molded, with iron wire points. And
stuff all around what is empty, up until the edge of the top shell with
clay. Next, place the circle around and put a clay <fr>entredeulx</fr>
on the first mold, a little above the notches. And having oiled the
<del>d</del> first mold &amp; its notches and the shell of the turtle,
&amp; having also showered it with eau-de-vie, heat your water, wet you
sand with a little water of sal ammoniac &amp; the said hot water, &amp;
cast. Having set, adapt the sides of these two molds smoothly &amp; on
each side secure their joint, which only recognize each other a little,
with two cramps, in order that when uncovering afterwards the underneath
of the turtle, they are not undone. Next, uncover the side of the belly
&amp; of the throat, in the way that you uncover a crayfish, which is
the most difficult to mold of the little beasts, which are molded in two
halves.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>You can mold the <al>turtle</al> with
one piece for each side, but one would need to burn it. Afterwards, to
make the hollow, the reheated mold cannot be <m>oiled</m> because it
drinks the <m>oil</m>.</ab>

If there is some <m>crocum</m> in the sand, the joints of the molds will
almost not recognize each other. </ab>
