<ab>If, once it is ground, you let it dry without keeping it in
<m>water</m>, it will dry out &amp; you will have as much trouble
grinding it as before. <del><add><fr>La</fr></add></del></ab>

<head>Stretching a <m>canvas</m> portrait</head>

<head><m>Plaster</m> for molding</head>

<ab>When it is long to set &amp; dry, it is a sign that it is too fat
&amp; moist, which is what makes it contract in fire &amp; crack,
causing fins. That which is drawn from lean <m>soil</m> is the best.
Moulds of fat <m>plaster</m> ought not to be kept for a long time, for
they act like fatty <m>earth</m>, which when drying by itself, cracks.
It is best to reheat them soon after they are made, &amp; to cast. Good
<m>plaster</m> keeps a long time as molds.</ab>

It needs to be well <m>oiled</m>, for it is more difficult to separate
the two halves of the moulds than when it is mixed.</ab>

<ab>It is imitated with <m>lake</m> that surpasses it in beauty if, with
this distempered in <m>oil</m>, you glaze on <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m>. Distempered in <m>varnish</m>, it dies.</ab>

<ab>You could well make some puncheons according to the form of their
scales, &amp; making some bigger &amp; some smaller, according to the
shape of the neck, the body &amp; the tail. If there is something
broken, you can graft it on with small <del>pieces</del> points of
<m>iron or steel wire</m>, &amp; glue with <m>fish glue</m>, &amp; then
cover it all with gray or black <m>wax</m>. But it is necessary to let
the <m>glue</m> dry for one day without touching it.</ab>
