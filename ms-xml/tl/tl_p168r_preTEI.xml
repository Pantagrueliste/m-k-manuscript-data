<ab>a peg which one puts into the touch-hole, &amp; then, with a rope
wrapped around the end of a stick, one gives fire &amp; promptly
retreats to take cover. The small petards of 16 or 17 lb are attached
promptly with a short hooked peg made like a
wimble<comment>c_168r_01</comment>, &amp; if the petard is of a good
alloy, one can give fire by hand just as one does with petards of 27 lb,
but then one only puts in three lb of powder. It must certainly be a
strong door if the seventeen lb petard does not blow it up. Some use
little bells worn by oxen or mules on a peasant door. Others load two
pistol barrels &amp;, with a gimlet &amp; a string, attach them with the
muzzle against the door. If the petards are good &amp; do not explode,
they only recoil and cannot do harm if one is next to them.</ab>

<ab>A. This is a small peg, hooked like the hinge of a door &amp; made
like a gimlet on one end for quickly attaching a small petard with ears
of fifteen or xvii lb for a common door or window.</ab>

<ab>B. This is a small petard with ears.</ab>

<ab>C. This is a <del>larg</del> common petard of 27 or 30 lb pierced at
the breech, through which a large <m>iron</m> peg passes, button-like on
one end &amp; made like a gimlet at the point, for quickly attaching the
petard against a door that <del>does not have</del> is not covered with
<m>iron</m> plates.</ab>

<ab>D. These are plates of <m>wax</m>, <m>cork</m>, &amp; <m>wood</m>
for loading the petard &amp; sealing the powder well.</ab>

<ab>E. <del>This</del> <m>Iron</m> fork made in the form of pincers of
the height of a man, to quickly place the mortar without a peg. It must
be of <fr>doux</fr> <m>iron</m> in order that its branches bend easily,
if need be, to fit to the height or width of the door.</ab>

<ab>F. This is another <m>iron</m> fork of the same height that props up
the fork made like pincers &amp; also supports the petard, and with its
claw at the bottom prevents the pincers from recoiling.</ab>
