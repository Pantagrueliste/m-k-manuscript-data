<ab>They are two small plates of iron attached by four small iron
pillars, in such a way, however, that <del>lles</del> the
<add>upper</add> is able <del>nt</del> to have play &amp; run freely the
length of the pillars, &amp; that the lower one is fixed. At the end of
the pillars is affixed a St Andr√© cross of iron, in the middle of which
is a screw which tightens the small sheets against the molds which are
between the two. Or, for small molds, one makes a frame, &amp; having
put the molds between two sheets of iron, one <del>sets</del> tightens
them in the frame with wedges. The large wooden presses made with
screws, besides being heavy to put near to the forge for casting, one
cannot know when they tighten too much, &amp; very often they break the
mold.</ab>

The screw is riveted to this stirrup which is nailed on to the upper
plate, &amp; by this means, raises it &amp; presses it.</ab>

<ab>If it is cast thick, it bears down too much on the <m>flowers</m>
&amp; constricts them &amp; reduces them as if massed together. Take
heed therefore to wet it until thin, &amp; blow thoroughly before the
<m>flower</m> is covered. Cast at the side of the mold. And wetting the
sand, one ought not only turn the palette, but beat the sand in water as
if you were beating glair of egg.</ab>
