<ab>Having therefore let your <al>crayfish</al> dry a little in the sun
or on its own, if it has eggs, they will shrink while drying and will
only be more beautiful. Therefore make your slab of yellow potterâ€™s
earth, like for other figures, lay your <al>crayfish</al> on top, the
<del>s</del> back <del>on top</del> on the bottom, &amp; the legs, belly
&amp; eggs, which are all the most fanciful parts to mold, on the other
side and on the top. Push the back down in the slab of clay, up to near
the legs, which is about halfway. And fix the body with an iron point in
the middle &amp; if it seems necessary, another, at the end of the tail.
And in order that the big legs show themselves lower than the head,
which is <del>enf</del> half sunken, extend them &amp; from underneath
add to them a little clay to raise them. Hide also the horns in the
clay, under the big legs, to arrange them afterwards as you will like.
As for small legs, extend them on the clay until the joint, and the
other half of the legs remain above, curved, for the first cast.
However, in order that they do not move &amp; detach, secure them well,
not only on the clay, but <del>att</del> fix them with wax &amp; a
little hot iron straight in the joints. And if you want to find the most
fanciful cast, you can attach the end of one of the legs with the same
wax on the body, or on one of the big legs, and aso make, if it has
eggs, the tail to be half folded on the eggs, &amp; fix it in this form
with an iron wire point. Take special heed, since the thing is
<del>s</del> thusly arranged, that it can be well cleaned. Lastly,
having rubbed the crayfish with eau-de-vie, cast your sand. Having set,
uncover the back of the crayfish, the head &amp; the eyes &amp; its
little pincers, the big legs and the small legs all along, for one needs
to uncover the most that one can, both the long horns &amp; the tail,
except if you have folded &amp; curved it to hold the eggs. Other
animals</ab>

<ab><margin>left-top</margin>Secure what has detached, like the hairy
brows near the mouth, with some melted wax underneath.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Uncover the most that you can, but take
heed that the notching that you make in the mold will release well.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Make the mold lean on the side that is
the thickest of the animal.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>To paint it, one does the middle of the
back <del>mixed</del> with <m><fr>vermeillon</fr></m>, mixed with a
little <m>lake</m>, and the sides &amp; the belly &amp; underneath the
legs is of a carnation made of <m><fr>vermeillon</fr></m>, <m>white of
ceruse</m>, a little yellow <m>ochre</m>. As in this &amp; all other
things, have always the natural thing in front of you to imitate
it.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>Lay the horns on the big legs,
<del>&amp;</del> or make with whitened latten wire &amp; solder
them.</ab>

<ab><margin>bottom</margin>Take heed<del>d</del>, when modling, to
arrange the legs in such a way that they do not pass the belly of the
crayfish, <del>Aultr</del> and that, placing them, they sit well on the
belly, otherwise they move.<ill/></ab>
