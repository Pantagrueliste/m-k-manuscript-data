<head>Cannons</head>

<ab>They are very difficult to bore when they are of <m>metal</m> since
the material is brittle &amp; frangible. But you must not push the borer
too strongly or push all at once, but pull it out often. In that case,
the muzzle of the cannon is bigger than the ball in order to avoid the
necessity of drilling, because the material is cast &amp; expands &amp;
pushes the mold. The drill should be neither like a swallow tail, nor a
point, but should cut in the round like a wimble. If it breaks, one
ought not leave it there to rust <figure>+</figure></ab>

you will do by pouring a little <m>oil</m> on it and then turn the place
of the touch-hole downwards and &amp; strike the opposite side from the
touch-hole, &amp; it will fall out. It is necessary and at ease drill
gently &amp; with ease when a piece is of metal.</ab>

<ab>Some take <m>orpiment in leaf form</m> &amp; pulverize it &amp; make
<fr>moresque</fr> leaves &amp; burnish it, and it is this
<m>orpiment</m> which is shiny like <m>gold</m>. However, <m>ground
metals</m> or <m>ground <fr>cristallin</fr></m> or <m>touchstone</m> are
better.</ab>
