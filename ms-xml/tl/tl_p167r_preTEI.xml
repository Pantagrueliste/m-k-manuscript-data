<ab>Petards are made of the best alloy of <fr><m>métal</m></fr> &amp;
the finest possible <fr><m>rosette</m></fr> so that they do not burst,
that is to say one part <fr><m>métal</m></fr> &amp; two <x>parts</x>
fine <m>rosette</m> or old caudron, which is even better. Some of them
are of fifteen or seventeen lb. and are loaded with two and a half lb.
of <m>corned powder</m>, &amp; they are put on common windows and doors.
Others are of a weight of 25 to 27 lb. and are loaded with eight lb. of
powder. And in such a way, they are formed according to the effort they
have to do. On the outside, they are all the same shape, but in the
inside, they are made like a crucible, <figure>

the mouth. And this is to reinforce the breech, given the quantity of
powder they hold, and so that they do not burst. Those of 45 lb. have a
thickness of eight <ms>lines</ms> at the bottom, and get thinner on the
inside towards the opening, which is of 4 <ms>lines</ms>. They are xii
<ms>inches</ms> long, and seven in diameter at the mouth and
