<head>Gate</head>

<ab>

When you make the gate of some delicate animal, like a <al>snake</al>,
make it come from the side of the belly &amp; under the tail, for from
the side, there are only straight lines, which are a lot easier to
repair than the back, which is more visible &amp; more marked.</ab>

<head>Repairing burrs</head>

<ab>

Having gently removed them with the point of a <fr>chaple</fr>, or with
a burin, scrape them with the side of the burin, or gently with a small
file, &amp; rub with willow charcoal &amp; little brushes. Continue, as
well, with the lines disturbed by the burrs.</ab>

<head><m>Leady</m> <m>silver</m></head>

<ab>

It degrades a lot, because the lead, which is mixed in, works it like in
the cupel, and makes it jump in little balls at the edges of the
crucible, &amp; on the charcoal which covers it. It is also fat, and
thusly it is good to melt all coined silver, like realles &amp; others,
&amp; to put it in ingots before melting it for casting lizards &amp;
animals, for it comes out better. I molded with it neatly thus, first of
all, a little silver viper, and made the alloy out of 4 realles of 20
<fr>sols</fr> from Spain &amp; a coin of xx <fr>sols</fr> from
France.</ab>

<head>Blowing</head>

<ab>

When you melt <m>silver</m> &amp; <m>gold</m>, do not blow strongly
&amp; with violence, because with the <m>charcoal</m> consolidating, the
crucible would lower &amp; <del>the silv</del> could fall over. But when
your mold is ready, at that moment blow strongly to well heat the silver
or gold. Both, once melted, want to be blown from above with a little
bellows, especially gold, for this removes their smoke &amp; softens
them. </ab>
