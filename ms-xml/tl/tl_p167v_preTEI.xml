Those of 27 lb or thereabouts are ix <ms>pousses</ms> long &amp; 6 in
diameter at the muzzle. At the breech, they are 6 <ms>lines</ms> thick,
&amp; 3 at the muzzle. The ones weighing 17 lb are 8 <ms>pousses</ms>
long &amp; five at the muzzle. One covers them all together, all the
forks &amp; pegs &amp; tools which one uses, with a big canvas or big
cloth in order that they do not make any noise. It is good that they
should sit loaded for some time. After one has put the <m>powder</m> in,
one tamps it down quite thoroughly, and then one puts in pressed
<m>paper</m>, then a cake of <m>wax</m> well tamped down, &amp; on the
<m>wax</m> another plate of <m>cork</m> that that goes in quite
precisely &amp; with force. In this way, the <m>powder</m> remains well
sealed &amp; gives much greater violence, &amp; if you wish, you can put
on the plate of <m>cork</m> one of wood pierced in the middle, if the
petard is pierced at the breech, which one holds to be the easiest &amp;
which makes for greater penetration because it cannot recoil. And for
those that have a pierced breech, one must have a good gimlet to first
make the hole in order that the peg, which is made <del>in</del> with a
gimlet-like point, may attach the petard faster &amp; without noise. And
<del>to</del> for these, one must cover the button, which is quite
evenly filed, <del><fr>p</fr></del>with <m>waxed canvas</m>, or add
<m>wax</m> to it in order that it precisely plugs the hole of the
breech. But because the doors are sometimes iron-clad &amp; the iron
pegs cannot pierce it, one uses an iron fork made like pincers &amp;
another iron rod <del><fr>q</fr></del> made with three claws at the end,
as you see depicted. And in this way, the petard holds itself well &amp;
is quickly placed. The iron pegs must extend from the petard with the
entire point that is made like a gimlet, namely by three or 4 fingers,
which goes entirely into the door. When the petards are placed, one
fills the touch-hole with good
<m><fr>pulverin</fr></m><comment>c_167v_01</comment> and
<del><fr>s</fr></del> one puts in it a <m>feather quill</m> filled with
<m>powder</m> tightly pressed &amp; moistened with <m>vinegar</m>, or,
if needed, one presses the powder in the hollow of the hand &amp; having
wetted it with <m>saliva</m>, one makes from it something like a cocoon
