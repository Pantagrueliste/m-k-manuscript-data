<head>Loading an arquebus</head>

<ab>You ought to have different charges according to the range that you
want to give to your arquebus, all of which should have a screw on the
end that fits in the nut of the the ramrod of the said arquebus. Thus,
when you have put the powder in the charge, which is in the nut, hold
the ramrod upright. And raising your arquebus up, insert the said ramrod
until the charge is at the bottom of the arquebus, then right the
arquebus, the mouth of the barrel up, and remove the ramrod. Thus your
powder will be entirely in the breech without any of its grain or dust
attaching to the sides of the arquebus, which always has some filth in
the chamber. Thus it will not push back, and you will shoot more
true.</ab>

<head>For adjusting an untrue cannon</head>

<ab>Take off the breech and place it on an even &amp; well-leveled table
and pass through the inside a very even string without knots, on each
end of which there should be a plumb hanging from each side. Then look
into the barrel along the string, and if it does not touch equally all
over, note the place where it does not touch &amp; hit with a hammer on
the outside on that side &amp; in the same place, &amp; thus it will be
righted, &amp; do thus all the way round.</ab>
