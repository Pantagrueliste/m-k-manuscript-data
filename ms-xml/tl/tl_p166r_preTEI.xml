<ab>

If something is omitted: the <pro>harvester</pro> is not reproached for
leaving some ears of <pa>wheat</pa>. If any <pro>artisans</pro> complain
that one discovers their craft secrets, and if the
goddesses<comment rid="c_166r_02"/> of <pl>Eleusis</pl>
complain, as they did to <pn>N</pn><comment rid="c_166r_03"/>. The
<pn>pytagorien</pn>,<comment rid="c_166r_05"/> that one has divulged their mysteries, excuse
yourself based on the words of the ancient <pl>Hebrews</pl> quoted by
<pn>Josephe</pn><comment rid="c_166r_11"/>.<comment rid="c_166r_04"/></ab>

<ab>

As the <al>hen</al> carefully searches the garbage thrown out of a
<env>house</env> for a crumb or a grain that she divides among her
<al>chicks</al>, thus one distributes to <pro>orphans</pro> that which
has been sought among the arts considered vile &amp; abject.</ab>

<ab>

Tablet of <pn>Cebés</pn>,<comment rid="c_166r_12"/> idle, but the
<env>workshop</env> represents all things
active. </ab>

If the jealous<comment rid="c_166r_10"/> disapprove that these things are picked up &amp; taken
from others, reply that since <la>Nullum est jam dictum quod non dictum
aut factum sit prius</la><comment rid="c_166r_06"/> &amp; that one
holds that all arts were invented <tmp>in the space of a thousand
years</tmp>, so that you do not think that you are able to invent
anything new but rather rediscover anew the books of <pn>Numa</pn>,<comment rid="c_166r_13"/>
buried <del>par</del> &amp; <tmp>long</tmp> unknown &amp; forgotten, in order to
publish them for those who do not know them; so that as the
<tmp>preceding day</tmp> is teacher for the <tmp>subsequent</tmp>,
thus you needed to learn from those who preceded you in order to teach
to those who come after. The <pl>Latins</pl> took from the
<pl>Greeks</pl>, as <pn>Ciceron</pn><comment rid="c_166r_14"/> 
from <pn>Platon</pn><comment rid="c_166r_15"/> &amp;
<pn>Vergile</pn><comment rid="c_166r_16"/> from <pn>Homere</pn>.

only made a collection from various <pro>authors</pro> who had already
written. <pn>Tite Live</pn><comment rid="c_166r_20"/> made his xxiii book from the 2nd or 3rd of
<pn>Polybe</pn>.<comment rid="c_166r_21"/> <pn>Serapis</pn><comment rid="c_166r_22"/> was deemed the <pro>inventor</pro>
of agriculture among the <pl>Egyptians</pl>, &amp; however so was
<pn>Cerés</pn><comment rid="c_166r_23"/> among the <pl>Sicilians</pl>. <pn>Pythagore</pn><comment rid="c_166r_05"/> &amp;
others from <pl>Tyana</pl> learned by their travels the disciplines
which they claimed to have invented in their country, &amp;c. Will one
not say the <pro>weaver</pro> has made a cloth or precious stuff, even
though he did not dye &amp; twist, wind &amp; prepare the bobbins and
balls of thread? Will one say the <pro>mason</pro> has not made a
<env>house</env>, but only piled up ready-made stones?
