<head>Preparation of <m>sand</m> for frames</head>

<ab>After your <m>sand</m> <del>de noyau dalu</del> of <m><fr>gip</fr>
of <la>lateribus</la></m> &amp; <m><la>alum<corr>in</corr>e
jameni</la></m> was used in <fr>noyau</fr>, gather the lumps from the
molds, break them on a long table with a large billet in order to
pulverize<del>s</del> them well, and, better yet, sieve it finely. Put
them in some pots into the tilerâ€™s oven or bread oven, several times,
when it is well lit, in order that they become very red. Once cooled,
repestle them, if needs be, and sieve. Next, put it in a sufficient,
neat dish, or <fr>semal</fr> or vessel, and wet it with clear water, and
grind it &amp; stir with a large stick, until it is well wet &amp;
washed &amp; that the filth goes on the surface of the water &amp;
continue to stir it thus, like the <fr>gip mat</fr> that one prepares to
gild with burnished gold, five or six days, until it is not at all
lumpy. <del><figure>#</figure> <la>nota</la></del> And, each time that
you stir it again, leave it to rest &amp; empty the clear water which
will be on top, by tilting, or with a bowl or sponge, and put some clear
water back in, &amp; thus wash &amp; stir it until it is well fine &amp;
cleansed of all filth. Nota, <figure>#</figure>. Next, leave it a little
to drain and dry, and make from it some little balls wetted in water of
sal ammoniac, and once thusly <del>d</del> dried <del>l</del>, put them
to reheat at great heat in a reverberatory furnace, where they will be
be well red, a good space of time. Once reheated in this way, pulverize
them &amp; try to mold something in a frame, having moistened your
powder with some water of sal ammoniac. And reheat &amp; redden the
frame, &amp; if your sand retracts, one needs to pulverize again &amp;
wet it in water of sal ammoniac, reduce into little balls &amp; reheat
it &amp; redden &amp; continue so many times that it does retract from
the frame when you redden it. The main thing is that it is well reheated
for otherwise the sal ammoniac would not calcine well &amp; render the
sand coarse, &amp; for this reason, one does not need too much sal
ammoniac in it.

and <del>le</del> empty the liquid in another common vessel,
<del><ill/></del>, leaving the litharge, in order that the stones &amp;
earth remain at the bottom after. One needs to let it rest &amp; empty
the water by tilting &amp; leave it <del>dry</del>.</ab>
