For those <del>qui</del> in which one needs to burn something, and which
do not open before being reheated, one does not make any casts before it
is reheated. For large molds in which the gate is big and ample, it is
necessary that the gate be well notched &amp; scratched, in order that
the weight of the metal does not go with much force. They make hardly
any fins if they are pressed. But before pressing them, put between them
and the press some pieces of thick &amp; <fr>moufl√©</fr> felt, which is
hardly yet crushed, for it fills the concavities &amp; keeps the mold
from breaking. The clamps should be placed before reheating or drying
it.</ab>

When the ground from which you are making your earthen base to lay out
your <m>animal</m> is too soft, the pins you place come out easily when
you cast the sand and so the mold is spoilt and the design is defeated.
Therefore when you know that your slab is too tender and soft, spread
some hot cinders over it and blow with the bellows.</ab>

If you don't add enough <m>alum de plume</m> or <m>crocus</m> <sup>your
mold</sup> will easily crack when heated. But if your <sup>sand</sup> is
mixed as it ought to be, <sup>the mold</sup> will sustain itself. You'll
know it's of good quality when, while still hot after casting, it
immoderately soaks up the <m>water</m> when dipped and breaks easily,
because the <m>alum</m> and the <m>crocus</m> render it spongy. To the
contrary, bad sand, which is composed of <m>plaster</m> and <m>brick</m>
and is not well mixed with <m>alum</m>, breaks easily in fire and
hardens in <m>water</m>. If possible, cast all at once.</ab>

When you cast <m>lead</m>, your molds must be very dry, even if the
molds are large. The outside of the molds must be reddened, and it is
necessary to keep them in continuous heat until they do not smoke
anymore inside. Do not reheat your molds several times, but continue
when you have begun and do not let them cool in the cold because they
will crack. Let them cool near the fire. When your molds are still as
warm as above, remark, you can put your finger into the casting gate
without burning your skin. If your mold is large, it takes more time to
cure and to dry, and you must also cast warmer.</ab>
