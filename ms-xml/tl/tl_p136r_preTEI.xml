<ab>a mirror. And since you want to <del>cast</del> cast, put again a
little of the color &amp; let rest a little, always blowing with the
small &amp; large bellows. Finally, arrange your very red mold between
the <fr>moulet</fr> or in a crucible full of very hot sand &amp; cast.
And when it has set, throw, if you want, in the water. For gold does not
get damaged like tin, which jumps.</ab>

<ab>To melt <m>gold</m> in ingots, it is of no importance
to<del>gec</del> blow on top with little bellows.</ab>

<ab>For large works, the crucible of <m>sand</m> needs to be put in a
<fr>fourneau Ã  vent</fr>, to become entirely red at the end of the
<fr>fournaise</fr>.</ab>

<ab>The <m>gold</m> that the wind hits or that one forges, becomes
black. But a little aquafortis uncovers it immediately..</ab>

<ab>If you have some work of <la>sol</la> on latten to forge, like one
does small statues, put between the gold &amp; the latten a blade of
lead. And before reheating the gold &amp; reputting it in the fire, soak
in aquafortis &amp; it will be <fr>douls</fr>.</ab>

<ab>It is enough that the gate be of the thickness of the medal
<del><ill/></del>, that is to say from the middle of the gate to the
medal. But if the medal is very thick, one ought not, for this reason,
to thicken the gate, for a very thick gate never comes out well.
<del>Mai</del> It could well be made wide, to embrace the medal, the
most possible that can be done.</ab>
