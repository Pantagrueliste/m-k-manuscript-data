Make the cast, reheat the molds, &cNote
about everything above|-|

If your snake has been without eating for a long time, it
happens that, when you want to kill it in urine &
vinegar, it fills with a lot of water & swells, and
next it dries out as you fix & arrange it on the claytourtelle, and next it happens that when you have cast your
moulewetted sand on it, & it has set, it
ends up coming out such that between the snake and animal there
is a line of distance D, in which enters
the second batch of cast wetted sandM. Avoid this
therefore if you can. But if this cannot be, do not let this prevent
your second cast, for the sand which will enter in this void, will be so
weak that it will easily be removed with a small point, &
will not have set with the first hardened one.

Note that one needs more feather alum for
molds which should be reheated, like those for gold
& silver, & things that one needs to burn inside, than
those which release well, & and that are only for casting
lead & tin. However do not put too much in one or the
other.
