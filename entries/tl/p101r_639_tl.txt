Salt for melting

Mix saltpeter & common salt and melt them together
& cast on melted copper or ch in a
bain, & it purifies & makes it run marvellously. First,
one ought to decrepitate the common salt, that is to say
holding it over a good fire until it no longer crackles or, to melt it
better, in an four Ã  vent. And throw it neatly on
marble, then crush it & grind it very finely, then
put it in a crucible on as muchsaltpeter &
let it boil, & mix them together until



It cleans & purifies metal well.
