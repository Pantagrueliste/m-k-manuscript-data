Leady silver



It degrades a lot, because the lead, which is mixed in, works it
like in the cupel, and makes it jump in little balls at the
edges of the crucible, & on the charcoal which
covers it. It is also fat, and thus it is good to melt all coined
silver, like reals & others, & to put it in ingots
before melting it for casting lizards & animals, for it
comes out better. I molded with it neatly thus, first of all, a
little viper of silver, and made the alloy out of 4
reals, of 20 sols from
Spain, & a coin of xx
sols from France.
