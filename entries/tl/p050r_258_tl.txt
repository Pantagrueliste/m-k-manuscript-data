Molding

If you want to promptly mold something in demy relief that
comes to hand, fold some paper in five or six doubles,
& place it on the medal & make sure the
paper is folded on the back of the medal so
that it is well secured. Next take a stick, broad at one end
& pointed at the other, well softened and rub well on the
paper, &with the point of the stick retrace
the lines & proceed until you recognize that your impression is well
done. Then, at your convenience, slightly rub oil with a
pinceaulemp on the
>paper impression and cast in tallow or
wax or sulphur, & the paper, without
it burning, will render your design neat, so that you will be able to
mold it later in plaster or tripoli, and then in
lead & other metal.



Polished cardboard of little thickness & a little
moistened is proper. Then if you want, strengthen it with
papier coll√© on the back.
