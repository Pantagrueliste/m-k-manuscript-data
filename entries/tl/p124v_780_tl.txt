A means to make the gate for small female lizards

Because you always have to make the gate by the tail, and that it is
so delicate and thin that the casting will find it hardmetal would run with difficulty, especially when it is curled,
roll wax in little threads of this size



and apply some with the hot iron wire, as said, one at
the end of the tail & the others, that are applied in the same way,
from one edgeside of the tail to the other, as
you see depicted. But take heed to make sure, that with the end of
the hot iron wire, the end of the wax barely touches
the animal, for the sand of the second cast will not touch this part.
But make sure that the end of the wax arranges itself only at the
edge of the empty part of the first mold. Make also conduits of
wax around the legs &, around the contours of the body, which
are a little long & they will serve as abreuvoirs for the
molded thing.

When the tail, which is delicate and closer to the gate, comes out
well, the rest will also come out well.



The principal thing is that the ears of the snake come out
well-molded.



Your gate must be very thin at the entrance of the animal & of the
thickness of a knife.
