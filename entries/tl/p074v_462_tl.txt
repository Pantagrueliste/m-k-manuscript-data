For making yellow varnish

Take some gum arabic & make it tr
soak with water, then take some well beaten saffron, &
soak the said gum, and make it quite clear, then make your ground
layer on that which you want to varnish, & let it dry, & when it
is dry give another ground layer of the same, & let it dry as before
until it is dry enough. Then take varnish from an
apothecary. Crush by blows one far enough from the other.
Then wash your hands quite well & with your
palm spread your varnish.
