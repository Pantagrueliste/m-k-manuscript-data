Cutters of printing plates

To clean the copper plates, or to have worn ones
print better, boil them for four or five good hours
in a good lyewith lye which is quite
spent. Then make your ink with some linseed
oil & not with walnut oil & press with the
rollers. The copper plates are sooner made than
wood blocks, but they are not so appropriate for
printing promptly. The wood ones are laborious but also will
sooner have printed twenty sheets than the other will have done two. To
carve in wood, the secret is firstly to poach, that is to say to
lay the counterproof or drawn piece onto the wood block
& to make sure that the side with the traced line is stuck to the
wood. Once dry, you then gently rub with a moist
handkerchief the back of the paper which, by rubbing, will
become so delicate that almost only the line will remain, which, next,
one follows in cutting the surface. You could do this with historiated
glass & coat with noir dâ€™escaille, to then scrape
& layer your colors on the uncovered area. To make ink for

These rollers are good for printing promptly with cut
cartons different kinds of pastes.


One can place the plates among the linens when the
lye is quite fine, or also in a pot.
