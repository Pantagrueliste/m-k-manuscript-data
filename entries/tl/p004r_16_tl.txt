To remove varnish from an old panel that has yellowed &
varnish it anew

Take white soap & sieved ashes, &
soak both in water. And with a sponge, take the said
ashes & soap & rub the panel with them. And as you
see that the old varnish is removed, throw a
bucket of water against the panel to clean it.
Next put it for a quarter of an hourin the
sun to make it dry and to revive the colors. Next, once the panel
dries, you can apply your turpentine varnish.



Make sure the colors do not come off.
