Sand for flowers

If it is cast thick, it bears down too much on the flowers &
constricts them & reduces them as if massed together. Take heed
therefore to wet it until thin, & blow thoroughly before the flower
is covered. Cast at the side of the mold. And wetting the sand,
one ought not only turn the spatula, but beat the sand in
water as if you were beating glair of egg.
