Carnation

It is molded like the rose, marigold, & all
other flowers, thus as is said, namely, whole-mold flowers, & all
the leaves, if you want, in two halves, joining them by solder
for a more assured way, even if you could mold them together in a closed
mold. I cast one that came out very well. But it is necessary
that the the sand be very thin & blown thoroughly.
