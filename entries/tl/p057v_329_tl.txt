Images made of carton, once dry, have to be soaked
in thoroughly macerated and clear melted resin. This strengthens
it, otherwise they turn limp in wet weather.

Venice masks are made with a
hollow & male face of
copper.

oil other than lead white because the ceruse turns
yellow.

4 or 5 year-old walnut oil which is clear
is the best color, it keeps off dust. The kind which has recently been
drawn with the press in the manner of almond oil is
white, especially if the walnuts' skin is removed.
