Yellow varnish

One whitens very strongly & one cleans the guards well. Next,
one applies walnutolive oil all
over them with a feather while they are cold, and next one
needs to turn them over a good charcoal fire that is on the
furbishers' furnace, without them touching the
charcoal or the ash. And when they do not smoke anymore,
it is done.
