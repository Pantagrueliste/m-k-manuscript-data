Cutting lead

Because it is fat & grips & attacks the knife or
chisel, wet it & you will cut it like glass.



Sometimes gold &silver take on, through certain smoke,
some color during the casting. But these are not at all scales &
chappe, but rather this color goes aways with whitening
& bullitoire.
