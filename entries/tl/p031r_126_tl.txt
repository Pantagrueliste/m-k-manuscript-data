Varnish resistant to water

Flanders varnish, made with turpentine &
oil from this or from mastic, can come off and does not
hold up in the rain. But that made with huile de noix
blanche, as you have done, holds in the rain and is
very clear & beautiful & dries soon. This is why one uses this
one for painted banners & signs that one carries in the
rain.
