Cross of the commanders of Malta

This beautiful rouge clair which makes the field of
the white enamel cross is blood of fine tear of
dragon's blood tempered with eau-de-vie
or else Indianlaque plate, which in my opinion is made
in Flanders, tempered with clear turpentine & tear
of mastic & laid down on a silver leaf, not the kind
which the painters use, but a thicker kind, which is
burnished by those who make gemstone foilsAv or by goldsmiths, & that gives it
this beautiful brilliance.
