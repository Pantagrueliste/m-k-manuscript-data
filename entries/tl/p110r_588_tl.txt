Rock & grotto

One needs to pestle white & yellow marcasites &
diverse kinds of mines, & then wash them well, in
order that the earthy & powdery part is cleaned, & there remains
only the lustrous grain of the mine, with which you will
sprinkle your rock previously covered with colle
forte, if your grassegrotto is
r not for a fountain & for touching
water, and you will have a nice work.
