Rouge clair @
enamel

Fine gold is opposed to it, for  on it it
remains yellowish. But alloyed gold is more appropriate for it,
such as that of escu & pistolet. IfGoldfis not put back on the fire with its
own pale color renders the enamel a dead colour.
Ma And for this occasion, once cut, one puts it back
on the fire to give it a reddish color, to make the enamels
beautiful. Otherwise, they are matte.

There is rouge clair which, once it is used with
arene, loses its beauty.

Some can be found that have grains of gold inside, and it is
also the opinion of good goldsmiths that the good one is made
with gold.
