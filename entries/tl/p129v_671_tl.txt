Spider molded on a leaf



The very big ones usually have hairy feet, which are
difficult to mold if you do not lay them flat, or burn them with a
candle, or stiffen them & lay them flat, with
somesmearing them with wheat oil. Kill
them in vinegar & urine, like snakes&, or in eau-de-vie, and then shape them on a
well-made vine leaf, or other thing. Next, you can give them back their
capricious hair with bourr the sieved
fine hair of cloth waste, by smearing them with a with
fish glue, or similar things. Their true color is of
vinegar & verdet, & then fumigate them in various
places with sulphur. Having made your tourtclay slab, place on it your vine leaf, and the
dead spider in the middle, & pierce with a point of
iron or latten wire the middle of the spiderâ€™s body
& the leaf together. Next, place diagonally small points of
latten wire around the vine leaf to secure it well.
Then fix, with a little melted wax and the point of a hot
iron wire, the end of the legs, adapting them with the end
of small pincers. Do the same thing with the end of the
spiderâ€™s small cornicles. ReturnðŸœŠ

To make the gate for the spider on the leaf, and to
prevent the sand from covering the spider from underneath the
belly, furnish the end of the tail & the bottom of the body with a
little melted wax, & applied with the hot iron
wire, as you know. In this way, the leaf burning & the
wax having melted, there will remain two little holes in the leaf
which will be the gate of the spider.

The wax once cooled, scrape the excess with the point of a
pen-knife, in order that the end of the legs stay neat. Next,
place the circle of earth around & cast your wet
sand, like for other things. In this way, one will need to burn the
vine leaf in the mold, otherwise not. And to cast more
easily, let the animal die fully, in order that, when struggling in does
not mix up its legs. Having made your first cast, uncover the reverse of
the leaf, and make the second cast.
