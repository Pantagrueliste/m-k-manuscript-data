with them, & your wicker will light, & immediately remove
your handsjo thus clasped, &
immediately put out the candle. And then put your
hands around it again as if you wanted to cover it, & your

that you are holding with your two palms the candle
will light. Then immediately extinguish your wicker &
secretly cast it aside.
