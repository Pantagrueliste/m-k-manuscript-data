Fonte

The pot√©e is made of burnt earth which was
used in the fonte, this is earth bourre bolvene
in which one has melted it. One grinds it on a big
stone, & with this one one makes the
chappe of first coat of the chappe of
bells, where there are letters & works, & le
only needs to be reheated in the flame of a straw, and mold very
neatly.

The earth which molds in noyau is subject to making
it porous, if you do not rub well with a brush or your
finger on the molded piece, which should be well
oiled. And do it coat by coat, & not all at once.
