Birds

Which have been fed by the rod do not whistle among the
company of others if they are not in a separate cage. For teaching them
well to whistle, one needs to take them from the nest before they can
see & cover them with down or a hare skin. Thus,
having not seen their father and known his voice, they learn the whistle
that one teaches them better.
