Founding of doux iron

Most people consider that iron, once melted,
cannot be melted again because they only heat it in small
forges, in which it only becomes red-hot. Alchemists
undertake to melt it with realgar or lead or mixed
orpiment. But without all that, some have found a way to
the melt not only brittle iron, such as the kind used
for iron pots, but also douls iron such
as d that of pigs & ingots, which is the most
difficult kind. And to this effect they make a furnace in this
manner which has a width of one pan & a half &
one pan & a half of a depth of two
pans. And the tuelle, which is the barrel
through marked A through which the bellows' pipes enter, has
to be placed in the middle of the depth of the furnace such
that there is one pan of the mouth of the
furnace above the tuelle & one
pan underneath.


Each pan of the mouth of the square furnace
contains one & a half quintal, & the
pan of the round furnace holds two
quintals.
