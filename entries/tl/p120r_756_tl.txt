Sand for casting in gold

Take common sand of alum, of plaster &
brick, according to the composition as said above. Add to it some
more alum de plume. And mix in not the whole of a third
part of crocum ferri. However its quantity cannot
be harmful, for it is that which receives the gold, & thanks
to which it comes out very neatly. But it is good that your
crocum will have been previously in the furnace of
glassmakers, three or fourdays and three days and three
nights, in a flat box, where it will be not
very thick, so that it will reheat better.


You could cast well gold in common sand of
goldsmiths, should you add some substance that makes it
run. Before the invention of crocum, one would cast
flowers in silver, but not at all in gold. It has not been
forty years that one knows this in
Germany.

Sublimate is commonly employed by goldsmiths for
gold. Some add sulphur, but they & others are wrong,
for sulphur sours, even as it heats. And the sublimate is
agitated, boils and bubbles. It is very good to clean gold
because by its exhalations, it draws everything out as it goes up in
smoke. But to warm gold, & conserve its heat, there is only
the color, which is verdet, sal ammoniac,
saltpeter, & borax. This makes it run & you can
throw in a branch of wormseed.
