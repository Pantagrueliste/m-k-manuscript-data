For casting in silver

You need to arrange your animals as said, and compose the same sand
two parts of out of 4 parts of
plaster, of two partsreheated brick, & one
partalum de plume reheated, and mix
it well. Then, having been prepared thus, and you wishing to mold it,
take the three parts of an earthenware bowl, from which
the peasants eat their soup, of the aforementioned
sand, & add to it pure alum de plume,
reheated & pulverized in the mortar, as much as you
can grab with 4 fingers and the thumb, or a
small double handful. Then, mix mix well & wet
with a little sal ammoniac & the rest of the common
water+ & stir it with your pallet, so
that it all becomes like a thick sauce or light
mustard. & having rubbed, with the
pinceau, the animal with eau-de-vie, cast &
blow, and beat the table to shake the mold & do as
with others.

Do not forget to put in it crocum, for it prevents
the molds from cracking, & is appropriate for all
metals.

Alloyed silver is better for casting than the fine one, provided
that it is doulx.


One needs for the alum de plume to be well pulverized
and well mixed.

Sal ammoniac is a friend of gold & of
silver.

Which needs to be placed before the sand in the bowl,
which is put in the water, & not the water in the
sand

Latten is the enemy ofgold & the friend of
silver.
