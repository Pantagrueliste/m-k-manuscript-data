Catching lizards and snakes

Take a stick and attach a string at the end, which
has a knoteyelet slip
eyelet at the end. And, being two to three, to distract the
lizard while whistling, approach the eyelet towards his neck,
and when his head is inside, pull. The lizard is more
tedious to catch by hand than the snake &
bites without letting go & grips like pincers.

Snakes can be caught by hand, provided
that it is covered by a thick woollen cloth, for the
teeth of the snake stay in the cloth, & cannot
pierce like they would with a linen. The dangerous ones are
recognisable by their blue & asses asure
azure eyes. They hardly ever bite in
water, which crayfish catchers
experience.

The sand mixture is of two parts of plaster pulverized
& reheated as said, & of one part of tile,
reddened et pprein a good
fire, after the first cooking & then finely pulverized, and of
feather alum, half of brick, namely two
full crucibles of plaster, one of brick
& a half of feather alum. There can never be too
much feather alum,s for this is
what gives bond to the sand, and because it does not burn, it makes sand
withstand the fire without cracking & bursting. Otherwise, without
it, the sand would not withstand it. This sand, thus composed, is proper
for all metals, but if you want to use it for gold, one
needs more feather alum& than the above
mentioned composition, and mix in some crocum ferri, and
for it is this one that attracts gold.

It is necessary that all sand with which you want to cast well,
withstands the fire well, that is to say that it withstands
abonc a great firing without
getting spoiled.

Feather alum is awkward to pestle, and it does not
pass through the sieve. Thus one needs to grind it finely on
marble. And the one, white, que v
in powder, that apothecaries sell, is good. It is
grinds better su in the mortar by pestling
&dragging the pinon, thus you will render it very
fine.

Crocum ferri must be set ablaze in a
glassmaker's furnace for four
days.
