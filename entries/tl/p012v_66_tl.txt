Moulding stucco quickly

Grind & pulverize finely brick or Armenian
bole or sanguine & incorporate it with melted wax,
& thus melted, cast like the others on a relief medal,
& thus you will have a cavity where you will be able to cast with
plaster, crushed paper or terre chimolee.



Finely sieved brick is better, because the bole is too
fat
