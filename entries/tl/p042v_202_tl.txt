White varnish on plaster

Give two or three coatsglue quite white for
painting. Next, varnish with varnish of sandarac, spike
lavender oil, and a little mastic. And in the
evening put it into a vessel, all well-ground together,
without fire, which would turn it yellow. Then with a
pinceau, it is dry immediately. Pour the oil,
which will have taken the substance.
