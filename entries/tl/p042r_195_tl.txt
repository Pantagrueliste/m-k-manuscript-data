Wax for seal and imprint

For the large wax seals, one needs to have tepid water
always ready & apre to keep your wax in
it. But before, it should have been kneaded between your hands
to render it very even, for otherwise the water that would get in
between would prevent it from coming together. Next, you will press it into
whatever you want and put three or four pieces of paper on, &
with a stickyou even & round like a
pestle, you will roll it as if you wanted to polish it, and it
will attach itself to the paper, which will help you lift it off
the mold. Thus you will imprint better than if you cast it
molten. You can carve the figures & gild them, silver them, &
paint them with colors in varnish, & transfer them onto a
base of glass painted with colors in turpentine &
mastic. And if you want to apply these plates by inlaying, do it
with gum ammoniac  mixed with vinegar, and you will have
good glue.
