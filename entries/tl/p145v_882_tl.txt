Molding plants and flowers

One does not need clay slabs, because plants or
flowers are not laid on top, but as in air, without touching on any side
anything. & Only the escircle & contour are needed, which should be
higher than for flat molds. And thusly, take heed to make it
strong and thick according to the size that you want, otherwise it would
burst, the sand being inside. Secure it & fortify it well by the
foot & join well all the joints. Then, take your flower, well joined
& securely adapted to the end of
cir of the gate of wax, which should not be rough,
but rather smooth, in order that it can release well. Then, wet your
flower or plant in some good eau-de-vie, or else
moin placed in a long glass
