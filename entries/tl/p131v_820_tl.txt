When the cast of tin or lead becomes porous



If your cast work has become porous, it can be repaired with very hard
wax, that you can gild afterwards with silver or
gold. To prevent this, if you cast thin, the alloy of one
℥d’est of lead for
one lb of tin is good. But if you cast with leadfor a thick thing, one needs for one lb of the
latter, two ℥ of tin, for the
lead being fat & weighty, carries more. From this alloy, I
cast a large lizard, as if natural. In thick things,
if which keep their heat a long time, if there is little
tin, it makes it porous. Your mold must not be cold, but
of such a heat that you can handle without harm, or that you can
keep your finger in the cast without burning it.
It is also necessary that your lead or tin be like red.
Melt firstly the lead, & then the alloy of tin on top.
And as you want to cast, put a piece of resin & then a
little looking-glass tin. @If you put into the tin too
much lead, it does not run very thin. And to know
this, if l the tin shouts loudly,
it is a sign there is not enough lead. If it shouts slowly, that
means that is there is too much. Take heed


You can solder with the l’es same substance,
then repair it with the burin, file,
chaple & similar things.

Tin is a metal that penetrates, that becomes porous &
burns, and is fanciful to us, more than gold and
silver.

Lead wants not only to be red, but also lively & runny &
liquid as water, which is a sign of its perfect heat & the
moldch is so hot that you suffer with
your finger in it. Do not open until it is
cooled. It is a sign of a good cast, as much for it as for gold
& silver when it exits by the vents.
