For molding thin

After you have molded in noyaulae figur the first mold, let it dry well
before taking away the figure of wax, order in order
that the mold does not corrupt. Next, make a small lasagna of
paste of such thickness that you would like, and having smeared
with butteryour the hollow of your first hollow
mold, adapt the paste to it and then make your second
mold on top. If you were to smear with oil, it would be
absorbed & would not be as appropriate as butter.
