But because one needs to cast by the tail or from the back of the
animal, make it so that the vents come from the head & the middle of
the body to respond to the tail, where the cast is done, which is the
end of the mandore. And having done your cast, do not forget to make in
it some holes and notches because the metal will run more neatly, as if
the cast was even, for it gets corrupted in its notches & holes,
&does not go so much at once, & does not become as porous. This
done, join the two halves of your mold & strengthen the joints,
putting around these some small clamps of iron wire of this shape. They
prevent the molds from deforming & corrupting while reheating.
