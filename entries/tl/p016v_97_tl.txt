which is usually of a height of d three
pans& will reheat well the. But first,
it is necessary that you have reheated your furnacewith with a little of the big charcoal, such that
the bottom is red hot and then you will put there the load of
charcoal in the middle of which you will put your iron,
not all at once but ten or fifteen lb each time. And when this
will be swallowed & at the bottom of thefurnace,
always put in as much again. And add three or four shovels of
new charcoal which should be of the biggest kind and moistened,
in order that it may have more heat & and not be consumed too soon.
And when you see that your furnace is full of substance, around
two quintals, or less if you don't have that much, you will
leave the charcoal to be consumed by itself. And when the
charcoal is more or less reduced down to the level of the
furnace, you will be able to pour into molds &
iron or metal shells, which is even better
because one iron attaches to the other. And it is necessary that
the inside of the mold be well covered with wetted
ashes, in order that it does not adhere to it.
