Gold color

To quickly make a layer of or sur
mat on canvas or other oil panel, one makes fatty
walnut oilin the sun or on the
fire, as said above, for it thickens by itself in this way,
although there is neither lead, nor ceruse. And with this,
grind massicot, mine, & other desiccatives,
not verdet nor orpiment, for they cause the
gold to die. It will be dry soon. However, if the
weather is not clear & dry, do not shade it,
for if the weather is damp & humid, it would
turn black.
