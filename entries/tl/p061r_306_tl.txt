Lights

Your pinceau shows it to you by casting a shadow
which must always follow the back of your hand, not in a
straight line like this,

for the light would be too crude & too harsh, but obliquely & as
if at an incline, thus:

The panel needs to not be facing the
light head-on, but half turned
against it. And above all look for a soft light, for it makes soft both
the shadow & the work, as a harsh light makes a harsh
work.
