Molding hollow

Wax on its own cools too quickly & does not run well
everywhere, & tallow keeps well its heat & runs
everywhere, but on its own it is not good. But when wax &
tallow are mixed, the work is only better. Crayfish &
other small animals can easily be molded hollow for the body, but as for
the legs, it will be troublesome.



The first part of the mold, that is the first cast on the
clay slab, cracks more readily in the fire than the
second.
