Casting of lead

Those who cast those small works that are sold in front of
churches, y melt one for one
lb of tin half a pound of lead, &
cast in stone, & if they want their work whiter, they put
phalftin and halflead, but
the first mixture is the best, & does not become porous. One needs
to cast it rather hot, for otherwise, it would not flow. Others smoke
their molds with a resin candle to cast neatly. The
antimony makes the substance brittle & breakable. The
looking-glass tin makes the work whiter, but not more runny; as
for tin, it is good to the with pure lead.
Those who make very neat lead casts, use bodkins.
Pewterers cast in a copper mold. One says
that one makes the lead take hold on the glass with
resin. Some put into the lead a quarter of
tin. Looking glass tin  renders the work stronger.
