Casting

I have tried four kinds of sand for lead & tin:
chalk, crushed glass, tripoli & burnt
linen, all four excellent. But as for the chalk, it needs to
be of the softest kind you can find, like the Champagne one
that painters use. It releases very neatly, does not need
to be moistened with magistra or anything else, but needs to be
completely dry, in its natural state, finely
pulverized. The first cast is always the
neatest, however it will well withstand two or three. But there is only
the first one that you need to take heed of, when you want to remake
your box mold to take new powdered chalk that has not
yet been put to use, for the one previously used in the box mold has
dried out & has no stickiness & bond like the fresh one.
Crushed glass can be made from common glass sand, however
cristallin is more excellent, for common glass contains
glasssalt of saltwort only, but
cristallin contains both salt of tartar &
saltwort all together, which both help fusion, the glass
once calcined & reduced to as if to its prime substance. In order to
calcine it perfectly, throw your glass, lumps of whichever sort,
among the largest possible lit charcoals that you can, if you are
lacking some other tde foeut violent
heat source. And when it will be well red, throw it into
water.

Putty is considered excellent for these two metals.
