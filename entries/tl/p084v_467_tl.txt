Eau Magistra

Some people think that salt water is not good, because the
salt cracks in fire, & consequently should make it porous. a
result causes bubbles. There is only wine boiled with elm
root.

Charcoal for poncer makes for a good release, but
one finds the one of willow make it porous. The one
of oak or beech does well without making it
porous.


Try burnt oysters.
