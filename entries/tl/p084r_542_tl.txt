Sand from a mine in Thoulouse

The sand from Thoulouse, which is taken, from the
depths of the earth, from the small hill of Puy
David, is excellent in itself, but to make it withstand
several castings, I mix it with pulverized sandever &
moistened, which hardens it, & takes body & bond with it, &
makes it withstand more than five as many castings as you
wish. Try to moisten the crushed glass and other
e sands with the waters of the above mentioned
salts. It wants to be, like all natural sand, well reheated
before putting it to use. One pulverises it, because it is in a lump,
then one reheats it in a copper kettle or similar thing,
until it no longer smokes.


It is necessary to reheat it before using it. It is rendered better for
casting because it is reheated, but when it has been used a lot, one
ought to refresh it with new sand.
