For preserving

Vinegar made from ruejuniper
berries crushed together. With this vinegarburning
bricks shall be extinguished. And the vapor shall be received
through the mouth &
nostrils. This is to preserve
oneself when one goes into corrupt air: a
garment can be thus perfumed & remove
infectionfrom it, from a
room, house, &c. If you find yourself in a place where
you do not have this preparation, carry
rue &
berriespestled together, then, according to
your need, boil them in vinegar and use as above.
