Vinegar made from ruejuniper
berries crushed together. With this vinegarred-hot
bricks shall be extinguished and the vapor shall be received
through the mouth &
nostrils. This is to preserve
oneself when one goes into corrupt air: a
garment can be thus perfumed & its infection removed
infectionfrom it, from a
room, house, &c. If you find yourself in a place where
you do not have this preparation, carry
rue &
