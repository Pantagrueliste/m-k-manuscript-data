Frames of theGermans

Germans who work in miniature make frames not of
glass, but of canvas anointed with clear turpentine
varnish, namely halfturpentine oil & almost
halfturpentine, because this light, which is not as bright
as from glass, makes features appear larger to them. And when they want
to make something subtle like veins de & similar
things, they use pinceaulx composed of two or three
ratwhiskers.
