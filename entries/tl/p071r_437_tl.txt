Mulled and sugared wine



When the English have a cold, they mull wine in this
manner. They heat it in a largetin pot until
it boils, and when it is boiling up, they remove it from
light it with burning paperto know if it is hot
enough. Next, to ignite it entirely, they pour it from one
vessel into another, as one who wants to beat eau
pan√©e, and as they are doing this, someone else lights with a
burning paper what is falling from one vessel into the
other, such that you would think you were pouring fire. When the
wine is mulled enough, heat it again a little, adding a few
cloves & a sufficient quantity of sugar. And
they dri drink it as hot as they can to overcome a cold.



The common English put sugar in wine to imitate
for themselves the sweet new wine which they cannot have because,
owing to the long sea crossing, the wine has lost its
sweetness and is clarified before it reaches their country.
