For molding sulfur

Sulfur is made beautiful mixed with soot black or with
pulverized sanguine, which renders it harder and stronger. Having
let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like oil, mix it with
verdigris, and you m will cast in
plaster very neat a lizard, or something else.



You must not cast that which has not become well cooled & that which
has not lost all its pustules & bubbles, and has not settled down
well & become smooth like water. The
soot black gives it a fine luster & makes it neater. The most
beautiful yellow sulfur must be used, for the greyish &
lively sulfur is not good. Do not cast in wind &
in cold, for it would become porous.
