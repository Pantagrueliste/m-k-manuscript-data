Molding en noyau. Mixture of sand

Having reheated your sand, namely the plaster, the
alum de plume & the brick, & having
passed them finely through the sieve#, mix them this way, take four parts of
plaster, two of brick, & one of alum de
plume. Mix them all together with your hands,
quâ€™il in such a way that one cannot discern one from
the other. With your sand ready, you need to kill the animal that you
want to mold de in this manner.

# except for the alum de plume which
should be ground in a mortar.
