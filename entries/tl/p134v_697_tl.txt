Secret for solderinggold and silver for
small works



If some piece of small foot does not come out well in gold or
silver, by fault of not having made, underneath, a gate of
wax, beat some soldering gold very thinly, then cut it in
as many small spangles as you need. Take some of this phlegm
 or white thick which saliva that is found on
the teeth, & with the point of a burin,
apply it to the place you want to solder & place there a
little spangle of gold & next, with a little fat
earth, wet with saliva, make a small layer, on the
opposite side, to hold solder better. Next, pulverize on top a
little borax & put in the fire. Boiled water of
quince seed & others also.
