Molding with cuttlefish bone

Guard against keeping them in a damp place, for they are
well prone to getting moist. If your medal is small, cut the bone
in two then even it out with a knife. And on a hooked
rooftile, well dry &well smooth & covered with
pulverized willow charcoal, rub & smooth the two
half bones. Thus they absorb this willow
charcoal, which makes them release them, guard against removing
anything. Then on a counter bone, that is to say a lump of
brick, smoothed to the size of your bone, place
your medal, & then on this one, place the bone,
& press well with some other piece of the same size above. And for
the second time, mold it, but before, ponce on top with
willow charcoal & blow gently, then press as before,
and it will come out neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, one needs two
whole bones. All cast work is brittle & subject to
breaking, because the metal expands when cast, & retracts
& condenses when hammered. That is why, one ought to
retrace the cast thing with a chisel, & in this way the
metal retracts, and let it thus escrouir. If the piece
for molding is of high relief, first trace the mold & the
cavity with a pen-knife, to make way for the medal & then
mold. And if the medal has two sides

Before casting, heat the
bones in order to make them lose only the coldness &
dampness.

When the lead gets too hot, it
calcines.
