Lean white sand

Without bond renders well proper for casting, & having body, if
you grind it very finely on porphyry or calcine it,
reddening it several times in the fire, & spread it in
vinegar or finely grind it with water, as you know. It
also molds very neatly in noyau, as I have experimented. But do
not moisten it with salt water if you want to quickly reheat it,
for salt boils on the fire & makes bubbles, being pressed by
the fire. I believe that the noyau, gently reheated, would not
do this. I molded very neatly in noyau the substance of
skillets. White sandsmells like sulphur when
reheated, and I believe it would melt. And since the substance has been
cast in it, it acquires in the moldco{mm}e a luster as if it were
leaded or vitrified. I believe that glassmakers could
use it.



One needs very little of sal ammoniac dissolved in
water.
