Reheating molds

After your molds have been reheated le
& cleaned, the sooner casted is best, because if you keep them, they
get corrupted and dampened. Reheat the thickest, where the body of the
animal is, cast as soon as possible, because if you keep your
molds it will corrode and become damp. Reheat the thickest
part, where the body of the animal is, at the top, so that, if there is
something inside to burn, it falls to the bottom.

Mark the part on top to recognize it

It is only a good thing to leave the mold die down a little
outside pource, once well reheated, because it
remains red on the inside when you will cast.
