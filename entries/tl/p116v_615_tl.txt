Molding snakesin all weather

aulcu Because in the winter they hide
within the earth, some feed them des a lot in
barrels filled with earth & covered with
manure. Others make several moldsin
summer, because with one snake, you can make four or
five. And others mold lengthwise a natural snake,  without
it being in a writhing shape, with common plaster, reheated as saidpu, en noyau & in two half
molds, as said, then they cast it in wax. In that way
they have snakes that they can twist as they like, and then
they cast them in metal, as is said.


If, in twisting the snake from wax, some feature becomes
undone, you can repair it by removing the protrusions from the molded
wax.
