Molding snakesin all weathers

aulcu Because in the winter they hide
within the earth, some feed them des a lot in
barrels filled with earth & covered with
manure. Others make several moldsin
summer, because with one snake, you can make four or
five. And others mold, lengthwise, a snake, naturally without
it writhing, with common plaster, reheated as saidpu, en noyau & in two half
molds, as said, then they cast it in wax. In that way
they have snakes that they can twist as they like, and then
they cast them in metal, as is said.


If, in twisting the snake from wax, some parts become
undone, you can repair it by removing the flaws from the molded
wax.
