Working neatly

Never put down, if you can, two colors one on top of the other. But
after having made your design carefully, keep the space of shadows for
these alone, & also individually that of lights & highlights,
without layering one color all across & then highlighting or shading
on it. And in this way, you further your work, economize your colours
& work neatly. Which is the reason that, the colors not being
muddled nor mixed together, they do not die & you soften the colors
better, since they are not so thick.
