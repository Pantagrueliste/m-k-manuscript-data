Painting in distemper on wood

Because it is very tedious to paint in distemper on
wood, and because one is at great pains to make a good
a face on it, some thin their colors with egg glair
passed through a sponge, or mixed with the yolk,
water, & thoroughly beaten with the skin of the fig
tree. With this | they paint & soften on the wood,
as with oil, and this supports the varnish, but this does
not last.
