Kitchen pots are made well, in order not to give a bad taste to
the meat, with the same metal the bells are made of. It is
true that founablesders mix in
more latten to make them yellower, in order to sell them better.
But the latten by itself, &simply by touching it, is
stinking & bad smelling.

Latten does not lose, or very slightly, its calamine
in an air furnace when it is melted in a crucible, nor
does it lose it in a wood furnace, but it does in a
bellows furnace because bellows give intense
flames.
