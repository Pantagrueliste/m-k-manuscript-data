Plants difficult to burn in the noyau

Any plant which has a hard stem & like wood is very
difficult to burn in the noyau, such as asparagus,
thyme, & similar things, because they stay as coal
in the small conduits, & if they do not reduce well into
ashes, it is not possible to empty them from the mold.
Some reheat them, to this effect, two or d three
times. Others, putting several plants together in the mold,
pass through threads the plants & thees moulescircle of earth,
which is to receive the wet sand,plusi



This does proceed from plants that have a stem with lines, because
rosemary burns well, but it is in the nature of certain
plants.
