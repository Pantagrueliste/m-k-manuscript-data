Mold made in two casts

It is opened, once reheated, to be cleaned, next, one puts the
clamps on again, one lutes the mold &
especially the joints, then one slowly dries the earth. And then,
as it no longer smokes, one leaves the mold to cool until you
hold it without harm. Next, put in the presses or in the sand
in a terrine, & cast in tin. For if you
were to cast in silver or gold, it would be necessary that
your mold be reheated twice & cast, as it would be
red.


If your moldf, through the fault of the
plaster, retracts in the fire, one needs to open it,
after the first reheating, to tighten it again & clamp it
and lute again and tighten again.
