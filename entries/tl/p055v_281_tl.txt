For casting

Chalk most recently taken from the quarry is good
for lead. One ought not grind wet, but rather grind finely while
pestling or scraping through a sieve. Thus for pumice,
which one ought not grind with water, nor corrupt its natural
state. Lead should be slightly mixed with tin, in order
only to give it strength, and two partsoftinfor of lead for of one of
tin or more.
