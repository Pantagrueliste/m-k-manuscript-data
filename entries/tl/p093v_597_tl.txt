Azure

Azur dâ€™esmail always wants to be cleaned because the
filth that can be seen in the laveures makes it die. One needs
to coat it two times, & the first very thick, moving the
pinceau by laying it first lengthwise then across.
 It is better used on canvas, where it is imbibed
immediately, than on wood. Varnish returns it to its
vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To try it,
painters bring their palette to the
grocers, & distemper & alloy it with a little white
ground in oil, for in this way, the beautiful shows its
turquine vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most
delicate is the best for working. It is thinned working by
washing it.
