Take white copperas, & heat it a little on the fire, then put
it as a powder on a white cloth stretched over a very clean
glass, & the powder on top, then take
fountain water & pass it through the
cloth, while stirring the aforesaid powder with the
finger until it has all gone through. Then wash your
yeyesat any hour you wish
