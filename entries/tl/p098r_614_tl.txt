To well tin nails and other work, they file their
work very neatly. Then to clean it well & rid it of fattiness, they
make it boil in vinegar, then they wipe it well with a
linen. Next they heat it & pass some
resin over top, which coats it with a shiny skin like
varnish. This done, they melt some pure & fine tin in
their estamiere, which is a little square iron
box. And when the tin is well melted & moderately warm, they
throw in resin in to burn the filth, & then they let the
head of a nail or something similar soak a little, & having
remained there for seven or eight pauses, they take
it out and shake it, hitting the top with an iron to
make the tin that is superfluous fall off, & clean it with a
small stick wrapped in tow. And if it is not well
tinned, you will hit it hot with a piece of resin & do
as before & let it cool. When the work cools, it becomes yellow,
which is a sign that the tin is the right temperature. But it
becomes blue if the tin is too hot. Things t
thus tinned are durable & are not undone like tinning done
in leaf, thus at the end of a year they can be clarified
& renewed by heating & rubbing them.

Leadsmiths say that making a lizard die in the
melted il destin makes the tinning
become very golden. Or else putting in sal ammoniac.
