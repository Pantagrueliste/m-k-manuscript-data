Sand, slate, and burned earth

Very burnt sand loses its bond. Slate is reheated & molds
neatly. Next, it is true that often it becomes porous, like burned
earth also does, like fat sand also does.


I find that one ought not to knock on very finely ground sands, for it
shakes them loose, & make prevents them from releasing
neatly. But one ought to press hard and moisten them sufficiently.
