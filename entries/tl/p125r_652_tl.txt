Scimitars
To know
The workers from Damascus or from
Hungary, neighbors to the Turks, separate, in the
ore, iron from steel. And, from this
first steel, first melted from its ore, they
cast scimitar blades in sandsab which afterwards cut the other iron without any difficulty,
because any melted iron is harder than doulx iron
beaten from pigs & bars. Thus is the steel of scimitars, but
it is quite brittle. When one un-hilts b a scimitar,
one recognizes by the tang that enters the hilt that it is cast in
sand.
