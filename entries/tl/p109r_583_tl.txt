Molding wax

So that your mold grips, without repelling in any place, on
a shape or image of wax, one needs to smear it with oil
and moisten you sand with lukewarm water, for the cold
water would furthermore repel the oil & would not make a
good layer on it.



Smear well, very lightly, with oil, so little that it hardly
appears. Then rub with some eau-de-vie. Next, moisten your sand
with lukewarm water so that it does not repel the
oil.
