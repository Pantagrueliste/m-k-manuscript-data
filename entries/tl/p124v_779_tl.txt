Casting with gold

Molds are reheated better & more surely in a closed
fire, such as pot in a reverberatory
furnace. So that when goldsmiths want to cast some
important piece dâ€™or e that cost a lot to rough out in
wax, they put the molds in a pot & cover
them, & fill the pot with earth, sustaining the fire
that holds them together & tight. Then, they reheat the
mold, earth & pot together, and when
everything is well red, they cast the gold.Fine gold does
not run well, but alloyed gold does well.

Gold & silver do not sour, having been, once
entirely red and hot, dipped in water.

Gold is a quarter heavier thanlead.



When gold reaches its perfect heat, it is green like an
emerald.



Take care that where you want to cast the gold, there has been no
fall of lead, tin, or lime thereof in the
forge.
