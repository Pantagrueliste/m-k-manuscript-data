again very well, then add in iii â„¥ of
minium, & pestle well again all together, & put
it in the crucible, which you will cover with an appropriate
tile, a bit thick, in order that heat reverberates better
there. Then set it on the grill of your furnace,
having put under a few thick rounded squares. Next, fill your
furnace to the opening with charcoal, so that it will
be heaped, and leave it glowing, and always maintain the heat evenly
without letting the charcoal decrease. And for this effect,
always make so that the furnace is heaped & full of
charcoal, and maintain it thus for one day.
The first experience that I made thus, it only returned a yellow mass,
as is only vitrified minium, & some grains of
gold in a mass at the bottom. Try soldered gold
and accompanied with antimony.



If you need greater heat, plie put on the edge of
the opening of the glowing furnacetiles, one against
the other, for making the heat reverberate.
