Composition of sand

Everything once reheated as it said here above, take four 4 full
crucibles of plaster, two 2 of brick,
& one of alum de plume. Do not pass through the
sieve to mix, may because the
alum would not pass. Mix with your
hands, until neither one nor the other, neither white
nor red, is recognised among the other. If your plaster was not
strong, do not mix at all so much alum de plume, because
it softens the molds. Take head also that your sand is not hot
(since it has immediately been reheated) C when you
will want to mix it with water, for this les
makes molds too soft & breakable.





You may sometimes diminish the quantity of plaster if you do not
find it strong enough to withstand fire & if it cracks,
& in order that the part of pestled tiles holds up, with
the alum de plume, which you can also increase so that
it creates a better bond.
