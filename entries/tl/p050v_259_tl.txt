Small birds

Benarris sing at night if they are left
in serain, but they are better for fattening for
fine tables than for singing. Chaffinches are prone to becoming
blind, & their eyes become swollen at the beginning of
August. Goldfinches like lettuce seeds very
much, & often one catches them in gardens on seeded
lettuces with two lime-twigs. But because such regular
fare would be too expensive for them, they are ordinarily fed with
hemp seed. The passe solitaire is cleansed
with a spider, which one needs to give to it
once a week in order that it does not become
gaillardisse. The calendra is cleansed with dry
mortar, composed of lime & sand for keeping it from
becoming gaillardise & fattening too much. Young small
birds are cleansed with the same dry mortar, by putting some
pieces in their cages. The cuckoo lays in the nest of
benarris otherwise called verdaule.
This bird is very simple. I have heretofore given leave to two,
which after several days returned to their cage. For feeding
young goldfinches, one needs to pestlealmonds with pith a very little amount
of bread pith and lettuce seed or
hemp seed. If it is for linnet, some
rapeseed.
