Windows through which the sun will not pass

Take the aforementioned calcined saltpeter & expose it to
a humid air or place, and it will convert itself into a
liquid which, if rubbed on both sides of the windows, the
sun will not pass through; rather, it will give shade. One
needs to put the saltpeter on some clean thingplace, & it put glowing coals on it,
and continue all over until it no longer burns.



It also serves for melting & for adding in with alkali salt
for cleaning hands.
