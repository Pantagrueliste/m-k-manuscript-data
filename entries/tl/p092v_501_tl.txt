Congealing mercury

It congeals, just as I tried, by boiling it one or two
hours in a rather large iron posnet,
putting in, for an ℥ of
☿, ii ℥ of
verdetde and vitriol of
saltpetre, ana, with sufficient quantity of old
water from farriers.

Or else, melt 4 ℥ of tin, & as
it cools, purify it of its filth, which is on top, then, make a
hole in it & put in there i ℥ of
☿ & it will come out like tin if you
remelt it, but it will be breakable. And If you want to assay if it is
tin or ☿, redden a shovel &
put a small lump of your ingot on top. If it is tin, it will melt
& stay, but if it is ☿, will quickly melt,
then when crackling well, it will evaporate. One ought to congeal it in
a spoon or in a hollow crucible, & make a
moderately sized hole.

It can also be congealed, as I assayed, in aquafortis which beforehand will have eaten a little silver.
This one, mixed, makes tin & lead run.
