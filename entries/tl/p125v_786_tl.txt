Vipers and snakes



I molded a viper, which, for casting, is more appropriate than
any other snake, because it has scales beautiful & very
visible on all the body & principally on the head and under the
throat. It has a flat head, the snout reddish, tending towards
carnation, & snubbed like the horned aspic or like
un the top of a pig's snout, big jowls, the
eyes very close to the snout, and the mouth wide open, where it
has double canine teeth on each side, all coming out of a
strip of flesh that covers and clothed them. It also has, in the throat,
a tube of flesh, made like a dog's penis, from which comes its
stinger. Other snakes have a double row of teeth.



If you want cutthe to mold the snakes
their mouths open, you must cut off the head & leave it inside, for
it will not be released.
