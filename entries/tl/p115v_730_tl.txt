Reheating the noyau molds

After your molds have their gate, vents &
clamps, as mentioned, make at the end of the forgeen, or in some clean place, a surrounding of
bricks, and fill it with large half lit charcoal. And place your
molds on top, and leave the charcoals thusly to light by
themselves for a half hour, so that they heat little
by little and not all at once. Finally as they begin to become white,
beat peu a peu the thusly half-lit large charcoals
on top & blow with your little bellows, until they are
warmed. And thusly, little by little, invigorate the fire,
without haste, until you molds are well red on the outside
& the inside. If it is for casting some plant or some animal which
does not release well & in this case, one needs to burn
it in the mold & when you look through the gate
& through it you see the molds are very red & inflamed
inside, this will be your signal that they are reheated enough. But if
you do not see this signal, increase &continue the fire until it is
the case. If there is nothing in the mold that needs burning,
it will be enough that they are dried well on the same fire, if it is
for casting tin, they reheat better in a reverberatory
furnace.

Do not pull out your reheated molds from the fire, before they
have cooled themselves & take care that neither the wind or the
cold hits them while very hot, for this would make them burst. One
must not reheat them before they are dry and firmed up for they would
cast in a different way, and it is necessary beforehand to make gates
& vents & place clamps.


Take care not to heat the fire in one go, for fear f
that your molds crack inside.


They are reheated enough when the entire hole of the gate is red. When
it is black, it is not enough.


For casting in silver, one must not reheat two times
&, if there is nothing in the mold that needs
despouiller burning, simply because it does not
release well. All the molds of farriers are reheated
two times, first for
