Sweetening silver

When goldsmiths, who are working with large works have
forged their platters, it very often happens with their sheddings that
it bursts & breaks for being too soured. To avoid this, throw in,
when it is well melted, some dry mortar, composed of sand &
good lime which has been worked, & pulverize it & throw
it in.

Goldsmiths do not work at all with
realsilver, that is not alloyed, because it is
leady & when forging it sours.



Some solder, for small works & things which only go in the fire
once, with some old sol & reheated & beaten
carolus. However, if the sol is not very
good, the solder eats away & one needs to solder on it twice
& there is too much copper on it. Others solder with
halfsilver & halffine copper.
