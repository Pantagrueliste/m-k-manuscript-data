Cleaning closed molds

One needs to let them cool rather than blow inside to clean them,
for once hot they retain the ash. Once cold, they are cleaned
better. Take a thin wire of latten or a delicate
straw to clean the tail completely, for this is what makes the
gate. Blow into it & suck, drawing it to you. Before molding,
enlarge the tail with wax, then cut it,





& join & solder a tail of latten wire by
solder. The lumps of a flower, it is a little thing, for this can
be removed with the chaple, but so that leaves come
out well, then the paint covers everything.
