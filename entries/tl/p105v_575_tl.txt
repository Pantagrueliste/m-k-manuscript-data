Nightingale

It is necessary that the iron wire of its cage be the
thickest possible, in order that, thinking of leaving, it will not be
hurt. Cover, from the moment that it is taken, its cage with
canvas. One needs to force feed it the first
day, giving it taking it out from its
cage into the hand & opening its beak, & with a
small wooden pin, put it in its throat & make it
swallow. And continue thus until it is no longer opinionated. This is
done for sustaining it, for if it would become thin it would die.
