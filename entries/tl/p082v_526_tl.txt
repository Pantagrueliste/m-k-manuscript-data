Casting lead in lead

There are some who make their cavities with thick lead, then
cast lead in them.
Lead when not cast hot enough, is white, & blacker when cast
well hot.



One can make a lead mold. & to cast in it, fumigate
it with candle soot. But it is never that neat.



Never does Lead come so neat as tin.
