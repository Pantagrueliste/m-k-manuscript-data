Talcum mixed in the molds

I took the one from which I had pulled the oil. I crushed it
very finely even more s into a steel
mortar with a pestle, very lumpy like a file. I
rendered it very fine & in a cottony & downy powder. I mixed it
with sand & mixed it together & cast it en noyau. It
molded en no very neatly & one ought not doubt
that it holds in the fire.
