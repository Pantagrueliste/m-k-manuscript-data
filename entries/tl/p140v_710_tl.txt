Molding and shrinking a large figure



Mold it with bread pith, having come from the oven, or
as the above, & in drying out it will shrink & consequently the
medal that you will cast. You it can, by this means, by
elongating and widening the imprinted bread pith, vary the figure
& with one image make many various ones. Bread coming from
the oven is better. And the one that is reheated twice retracts
more. You can cast sulfur without leaving the imprint of the
bread to dry, if you want to mold as big as it is. But if you
want to let it shrink, make it dry, either more or less.
