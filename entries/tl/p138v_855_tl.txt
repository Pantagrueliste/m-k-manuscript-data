Counterfeit diamonds put in a work

Give a light coat on the inside of the setting with black wax
for esbaucher, then grease the inside, thus waxed, with
wheat oil, & then powder this with lamp smoke
for it is necessary that ceste its color not have
luster for false stones. This done, set in your stone& puys with a bit of wax, then with a
steel point & a small finishing hammer,
join the edge of the setting to the stone in order that
daylight does not enter in. But keep from knocking the
stone, which would break.
