Sand

Calcined black pebbles from the river are good for
lead, but they are shaken loose for metal.

There is only clay earth with which one can
make tiles, reheated & reddened & passed through a
sleeve finely moistened with glair.

Willow charcoal is excellent for sand for
blead.

Latten runs better.
