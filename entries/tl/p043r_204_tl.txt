White bronzing on plaster

One needs to give four layers of painters' glue in
distemper on the plaster portrait, always leaving each layer to
dry. Next, with mine dâ€™Angleterre ground on a marble, or
burnt lead, grind av & distemper with a bit of
gum or goglue, lay down lightly. Once
dry, rub lightly with a little cotton and the plaster
portrait will seem to be of lead. Others grind minium with
quicksilver.
