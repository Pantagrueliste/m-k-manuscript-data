Lizards

When one takes them with two fingers from the
sides of the head, at the level of the ears, one makes them open their
g mouth, then one takes the a
end of its lower mandible, with the end of the
fingernail, & after with the one from above
it bites the nail, but it cannot pass through, but it
bites very well. And if it were to bite living flesh it would
au not let go, & there would be no better remedy
than to promptly cut off his head. In the spring, as they
have changed skin, they are more beautiful.



The small lizards that one takes in the summer, the
size of small female lizards, grey on the back & green on
the belly, are very appropriate to cast in silver, &
gold, or other metal, because their have rougher scales
than the of female lizards & show better.
