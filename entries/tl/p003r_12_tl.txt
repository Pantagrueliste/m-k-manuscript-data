Counterfeit coral
+
One needs to first make the branches of wood or take a
bizarre thorn branch, then melt a lb of the most
beautifulclear pitch resin and put in one ounce of
subtly ground vermilion with walnut oil, and if
you add in a little Venice lake platte, the
color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the resin melted
over a charcoal fire and not of flame, for fear that the fire
catches within. Next dip in your branches while turning, & if there
should remain any filaments, turn the branch over the heat of the
charcoal.

Colophony is nothing other than resin cooked again. To do
it well, take a leaded pot & melt the resin,
& boil it over the brazier a good hour,
& until it appears not to be thick, but clear & liquid like
water & it easily runs & flows from the tip of a
stick with which you grind it, & try it. Then pour it
through a coarse canvas or a very light tammy
cloth, in the manner that when pouring it falls into the
strongest vinegar that you can find, for the vinegar gives
it strength & prevents it from being so fragile. Reiterate this two
or three times & it will be beautiful & well purified. For
imitating your coral, you can mix a quarter part of
mastic within your purified resin to render it more firm
and more beautiful, & if you should take only a tear of
mastic, it would be all the better, but it would be too long.



Sulfur & vermilion makes the same effect.


The coral made of gules red enamel endures the
file and polishing.


It is made like cement that is stronger mixed with crushed
than of glass rather than with brick. Thus one
mixes here with the vermilion the gules red enamel, which
is red in body, well ground. Thus with all colors of
enamels.
