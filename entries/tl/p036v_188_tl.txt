Glassmakers' glass

One says that in Lorraine & in Flanderswell-made glass is made of fern ashes &
pebbles, and first they blow up a long still, which another
worker, with long shears, cleaves & cuts lengthwise.
Then, having set this long, cleaved still on a stone or
large platine that is in the furnace, a little less
warm than the fonte, it is left to expand. And again in
addition to this, they flatten it with a large & long round
iron stick, then they put it back in the furnace to
reheat. It is made in the same way in England more beautifully.
Near Rouen in France, plate glass is made with
some salt ofsaltworth & pebbles,
that is whiter & more delicate than that of Lorraine. For
plate glass can be melted with a candle & not that
from Lorraine. That of plate is blown in a long still, which
someone else cuts at the tip, then the blower, while turning it &
while touching it to a plane that is on the ground,
A flattens it, then puts it to reheat. Thus the
middle where it begins still remains.



The glass can be remelted with the light of a candle
when wet, but not as evenly as with the hot iron.
