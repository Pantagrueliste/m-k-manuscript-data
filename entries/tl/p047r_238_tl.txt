Crucibles

Those from Bayonne, which seem to be made of
gr√©s are better, for they last, without comparison,
longer than others. And because they are not very thick, one wastes less
charcoal melting gold & silver, for they heat
quickly. They do not absorb as much silver as much as the others,
& for this reason, there is not much laveures to be
found in them. They are less likely to fall over as others that have a
flat foot.
