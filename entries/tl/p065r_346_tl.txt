Mirror

When you make flesh colors, it is good to have a
cristallinmirror, which represents
well after nature, and in which it you will see if your
shadows are soft enough or too crude. But do not look at it with a
candle, for firelight will make the shadows reddish.
The painter also teacher himself with the mirror,
for he sees in it what the natural can do.
