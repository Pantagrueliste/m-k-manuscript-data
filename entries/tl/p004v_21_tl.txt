Varnish of iron engravers

Take linseed oil or walnut oil
&, in place of black pitch, you will put in a little
resin, & it needs to be cooked in the manner of black
varnish on fire. And for applying it, heat your iron &
give it only one layer of varnish, & when it no longer
smokes, it is dry. Next engrave with a steel point
whatever you want. Next takesalt &
verdigris & soak as much of one as of the other in quite
strong vinegar & leave it for XX4 hours
before using it, & all will be soaked. Next spread some of this
liqueur or sauce on the engraved object with a sponge
