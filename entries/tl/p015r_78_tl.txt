Foundry casting

One casts candlesticks and small works in a frame with
sand. And after having imprinted the work, one sprinkles it with
flour in order to make the e metalcopper or latten run better. When the sand has been used
for a month, it is necessary to take some new, because the one
that was used, having been reheated in fire+, dries out & loses its ability to bond. However,
it is used to mix among the new, for it makes the work not so porous.
One casts large works such as artillery, bells & similar things in
earth, & copper cast in earth makes less of a
chappe, and is whiter than the one cast in sand. The
earth is sandy clay mixed with horse dung
& cloth waste. That which is has been used for
founding, which is black, baked & as if burnt, is used to cast,
gecte mixed with artificial sand, & is
very good. /To soften & make the copper run, throw in,
once it is melted, a little lead, which does not form an alloy
but is found on the surface of the cast.
