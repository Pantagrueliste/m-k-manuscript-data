Molds of plaster for wax

When your mold of plaster is done & dried, take
heed that your mold be of good release, for sometimes it
happens that the animal, being wounded or thin & withered, makes
wrinkles, where retire there being some scales, that
is where the plaster enters. And this not being of good release,
the wax animal attaches itself & breaks & you would never
have it perfect. Take heed also to make your gates for the
wax very wide. Thus & that the gates are not too thick.
They are made when the animal is the mold with both sides is made & the animal is
outside of it.
