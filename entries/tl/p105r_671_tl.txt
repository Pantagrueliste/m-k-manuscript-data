For grafting en escusson, one needs to take the new output
that the tree that you want to graft made in that year, &
there cut a branch on which you see that, next to
raci the sprouting of leaves there are little
buttons that one calls oeillets, which are the beginnings of
sprouts. One needs to nimbly, with a very sharp pen-knife, cut
in the shape of a shield a little bit of the skin with which
contains an oeillet or sprout with the leaf, thus marked B.
Butplustot Then carefully make on the
tender wood s which is full of sap, on which you
want to graft, two lines thus de cut , then
make in the middle a cleft thus



. Next separate with the point of the pen-knife the bark &
open it from the cleft in the middle, and having neatly lodged your
shield so that nothing comes out but the sprout, bind it well & wrap
it entirely with a slip of linen or very
soft thread, so that there is nothing uncovered but the leaf,
which in three or 4 days will give you an indication
whether the shield should take, accordingly it will be green. Leave your
graft seven or eight days thus, then unbind it &
join it well to the bark, especially at the sprout, & then rebind
all gently but not as strongly as before; & if there is any output
or growth, leave it space to go out; & do thus three or 4
times.
