Wax for molding -

As the wax is melted, they have sulphur that is
melted, in a spoon or crucible, & they pour some
in the melted wax. And the sulphur going to the bottom or
remaining on top, it leaves & mixes only its substance amongst the
wax, & renders it more meltable when warming it, such that
having molded, it melts in the mold gently, like butter, without leaving
any gently melts in the mold like butter, without
leaving any pustule or bubble in it. Also be warned to not give it too
much fire.
