Animals dried in an oven

Small scats are skinned and one
removes their eyes &all their entrails. One puts a small
stick vertically between their teeth to make them open their mouths
wide. Then with iron points one attaches their feet to a
small board, giving them the fitting attitude & gait. Once
thus attached by their feet with small rings of iron
wire, one needs to suspend them in the sun
with their spines downwards. In this manner they take
&d their shape & dry, & the belly
tightens & the tail remains high or with the bend that you will
have given it. Once a little dry by this means, one turns the head
as one wants, securing it with some tool. Then one finishes drying it in
an oven when the bread is drawn. Next, one places in the
hollow of the eyes balls of lead or of wax, painted
according to nature. One paints them with well-gummed ink so that
they seem to be jet. One gives it a painted tongue, horns, wings &
similar fantasies. Thus for rats & all animals.



which surround the fingers of the paws and which stick in
the jacket of clay.
