For making vermilion

Take two pounds of sulphur, & melt it, & put
it into two pounds of merecusemercury. And if this substance ignites, cover it quite
neatly, so the air does not pass into the pot, then put the
whole for some time after into a leaded pot, onto the
fire for the space of twenty-four hours. You will
have good vermilion.
