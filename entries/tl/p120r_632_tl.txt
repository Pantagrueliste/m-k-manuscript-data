You can mold in wax, mixed with a bit of resin so it
will be harder & firmer, the relief of whatever you please, either
an animal or a medal, & then, from it, make a hollow form of
latten or copper. Or hit itmold it
in relief and hammer it in a sheet of tin,
Et pu and then fill with lead & heat it.
Try sheets of gemstone foils molded in a hollow form for lizards
&c.
