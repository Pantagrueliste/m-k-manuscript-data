Plaster

When you v mold something to cast wax in it, you
mold in plaster alone, reheated after having been pulverized.
For, once reheated in stone, the outside is cooked & the
inside stays almost raw. Transparent grey plaster is not strong, but
a good one, is one, that, once wet, is white & sets very
quickly. However, the grey I have found to be quite firm, & hard
after having set, but its takes longer to do so. One needs to know the
nature of each. If you You will never mold very neatly if
ne you do not wet, very thin &
liquid, your plaster or your sand of noyau. Wet it
mortar immediately after it has been reheated.

If you mold with plastercrud alone, reheat it
nevertheless as said. One needs to oil well the first
mold. And when the second one has set well, and it is ready,
soak it for a long time in water. And if it does not want to
release, soak it in hot water, for cold water hardens it,
and hot water softens it further. Cold water does not
penetrate it like it does with mixed plaster, because it is harder &
the mixed one is more spongy. With this plaster, thus reheated as
powder, one can cast medals that do not fear the rain,
especially if they are varnished. One can find these in
Germany, on the houses. But take heed that the water be
very hot, & if it is boiling, there is no danger. All
plaster molds, pure or mixed, release in it.
