Colors in oil that are imbibed

It is best that colors in oil are imbibed, that is to say
they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if
in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the
oil has remained in that part which would make the colors die.
The varnish mends all this & unites & renders it similar
in one place as in another.

One needs gold color to be laid down thick, for if it is clear, it
would be imbibed & would run.



On canvas & in distemper, one gilds with bole
& honey & a little garlic juice.
