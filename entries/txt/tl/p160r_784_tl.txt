Press for the large molds

They are two plates of iron attached by four
small iron pillars, in such a way, however, that
theythe upperare is able to have play
& run freely the length of the pillars, & that the
lower one is fixed. At the end of the pillars is affixed an
ironSt Andrews cross, in the middle of which is a
screw which tightens the plates against the
molds which are between the two. Or, for small molds,
one makes a frame, & having put the molds between
two plates of iron, one sets tightens them in
the frame with wedges. The large wooden
presses made with screws, besides being heavy to put near to the
forge for casting, one cannot know when they tighten too much,
& very often they break the mold.


The screw is riveted to this stirrup which is
nailed on to the upper plate, & by this means,
raises it & presses it.
