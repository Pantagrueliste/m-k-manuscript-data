Plaster

That from the mountains is greyer, and the the
one from the region of Albi is whiter. It must be cooked with a
closed fire, such as a reverberatory furnace or fours
de barbiers. And the most freshly cooked is the best. It must
be finely ground on marble. After having prepared your
hollow form from sulfur or something else, & oiling it,
& having enclosed it in a circle, temper not too
thickly your plaster with water, & separate it well
with your finger, and if it makes pustules, throw in
more powder of the said plaster &  grind it
with the finger until +

+ it makes no more pustules. Then cast & sprinkle
once again with plaster powder & leave to set well, then
scrape off the powder.
