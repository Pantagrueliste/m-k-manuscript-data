The body of the cuirass

The high lames of the pauldron of the brassard  are like a
masterpiece of the masters, for these pieces it is necessary
that they be very precisely hollowed &
adjusted in order that the movement may be free. The bodies of the
cuirass must be very evenly beaten &
driven with a hammer.

Morions from Milan are all in one piece & thus better
than those that are of two.
