For knowing the good azurite ash for oil

The one that piles up in small clods and is lumpy is
the best because it is the most subtle. Also the one that is also very
pale in color, because oil darkens it. Certain
sophisticators mix them, but you will know this if you pour
some onto a piece of paper & lay it flat & smudge it with
the finger since, if it is mixed, it will be found
variegated & as if with pale & darker stripes, but if it is
unmixed it will be even & of one color.
