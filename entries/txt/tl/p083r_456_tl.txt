Recipep a  little-cooked tile,
ground & moistened in white wine with burnt black
trasse paper; & if you add burnt horse
dung, it will be all the better. Moisten with glair of egg.

Trasse paper burnt over a closed fire is reduced just as
charcoal & very soft black, molds neatly & makes it
release well mixed with the others.
