Arranging plants or flowers for casting



Always put on the top the principal side of the thing, because it comes
out better and neater than the bottom. Make the gate wide & make sure that
there issupraplus (which is the
masse for founders) for a large gate,
Et especially for silver, which wants the
mold quite hot & to be cast very hot. Very thin things want
to be cast very hot.


When you know that the stem of a flower, burned in a mold which
does not open, is reduced well into ashes, it is a sign that the
rest is well burned.
