Painting metal herbs

If you are in a hurry it would be better to mix your color with a
not-too-thick gumor because oil takes a
long time to dry, and it runs if it is transparently layered,
as the herbs require. And if you still want it done promptly,
mix your color with glair beaten with peelings of the fig tree, 
and your work will soon be dry. But layer it
transparently.
