Grafts

It is necessary that the graft not be from old wood for it is never
a beautiful tree.

One needs to leave only two shoots at maximum on the graft, for when
it has more, its strength is weakened. The wind torments it, & it
does not have enough strength to bud.

Trees which have coarse marrow, like peach trees & all
their kind &the plum trees, do not want grafts in
freezing weather because the cold damages their marrow, which one
also needs to protect from wounding by cutting the foot of the
graft.

All grafts must not be made earlier than their tree will be sapping,
for the humor grows them quickly. Otherwise
au, they dry too quickly that the humor of
the sap does not grow them.
