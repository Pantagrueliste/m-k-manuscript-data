Nightingale

It is necessary for him to have a cage made in the barn,
like those for calendras, doubled with green cloth,
because he fears the cold. And for making him accustomed to
eating when first he is put in the cage, one needs to give him
ants with soil at the bottom of the cage to
make it accustomed to pecking puys luy, and give him
chopped sheep's heart, & immediately some
eggs, & mealworms.
