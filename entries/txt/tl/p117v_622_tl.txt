Molding a noyau figures of wax or medals of
lead

Rub them with oil with a paintbrush, but let
it be so lightly that your medal is almost rubbed dry & that it
hardly appears to have been anointed. Next, destr rub
it with eau-de-vie and heat the water with which you will
wet your aforementioned sand, with plaster, brick &
alum, in order that being chau like lukewarm
when you cast it, the oil will not refuse it, as it does with
cold water, & do not forget when moistening your sand to
always mix in it a little sal ammoniac.


Medals mold in such a way very neatly.
