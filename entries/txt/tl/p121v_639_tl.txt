Silver for casting

It is not fine silver but alloyed, & which does not
become perfectly white on the fire, they put it to whiten after the
fusion to also clean it of the solder. or of the When
you need to attach some leg animal against another or to
repair, it is commonly teston silver. And, all
alloyed silver, as long as it is douls, is good.

Before starting to cast in silver, one needs to
have earthof which which withstands the fire, like
the areneuse earthde qu mixed with cloth
waste which founders use to cast their cannons, or any
good lute which withstand fire, in order to surround your
molds & fortify them, for one needs for them to be red. One
needs to also tie them with iron wire.

That before casting sil reheating the molds, you
have the mixture one needs to make the silver run.

If the goldsmiths knew knew the substance to make
silver run in their works, they would buy a lot. Some buy it five
sous for a denier.


I have used silver from the capital.


Before bindingluting & strengthening your molds
for gold & silver with the said earth, one
needs for the cast to be made & the vents, & the molds
to have been reheated of very red, to burn the animals,
flowers and plants that are inside, & to clean them well of the
ashes. Once well clean & prepared, lute them & bind them
with iron wire, & reheat them again until they will
be well red.
