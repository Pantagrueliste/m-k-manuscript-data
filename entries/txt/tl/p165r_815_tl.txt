Plaster for molding

When it is long to set & dry, it is a sign that it is too fat
& moist, which is what makes it contract in fire & crack,
causing flashing. That which is drawn from lean soil is the best.
Molds of fat plaster ought not to be kept for a long
time, for they act like fatty earth, which when drying by itself,
cracks. It is best to reheat them soon after they are made, &
to cast. Good plaster keeps a long time as
molds.



It needs to be well oiled, for it is more difficult to separate
the two halves of the molds than when it is mixed.
