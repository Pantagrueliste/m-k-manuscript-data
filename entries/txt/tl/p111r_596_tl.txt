Iron wire

You need to have enough provisions of different thicknesses,
according to the molds that you want to make, some thick
like cord, some  & some thin p,
like the thick strings of a spinet, for small works. You
make, once de reheated, clamps from it to close the
molds & the points, like needles of different lengths,
according to your need, to pierce the animal to be molded & keep it
subjected. Needles would not be good for this because it is
necessary that their points be empty & of the same thickness
throughout, except at the point. And then, one must make them as long as
you have need of. Iron wire is firmer than that of
latten.
