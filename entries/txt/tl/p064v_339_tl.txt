Apprenticeship of the painter

First, one gives him an egg to do in which one has him make
half a face, then a whole one with the ears, next the neck, then the
parts of the body separately, next joined, then one figure, then two
& three, finally a history, teaching him how to hold the
charcoal by the end, & also the paintbrush.
Once he knows how to draw, one teaches him how to layer colors.
