They have no invention for making a perfect red in a work, so that
one needs to reheat it. However try the German
red, which is rouge d'escaille. They make their common
red with some sanguine, looking-glass tin, rock
pieces, litharge & a bit of scales of iron. The
said red saturates one side & the other of the glass in order
that it has more color, if it saturated only one side it would be very
pale orange.
