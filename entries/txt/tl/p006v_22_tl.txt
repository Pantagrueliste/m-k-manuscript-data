For gacachcages

You can embellish them with thin enamel canes of
various colors by covering the latten or iron wire with the said
thin canes. These you will break neatly to the length that you
want if you slightly notch with a cutting file at the place to
be broken, and they will not break at any other place. You can bend
them with a wood model over a
chafing-dish or else by the heat of the lamp. It can
also be drawn as long as you want in a small furnace made like
a reverberatory furnace but which is pierced on both sides. And
when the large cane is red, they seize the hot end using
small pincers with a long beak, such that one prong of the beak
of the small pincers enters inside the end of the thin
cane, & thus it is lengthened without becoming stopped, &
the other end of the thin cane is held with the hand,
because it is not hot. When the thin cane is stretched enough,
the one who works seated, having his furnace,
the size of a carnation pot, before him,
breaks it off & continues. This is for making thin
canes for capes, which are cut as already mentioned, and with a
file. Glass button makers also avail themselves of
the said furnace.
