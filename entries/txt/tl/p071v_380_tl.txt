The cimol√©e is very good for casting in
copper, but one ought not take the one from
cutlers, because it is only sludge, but rather the
one of those who moulent mold large shears.

Pierres de filieres, which knife grinders use for
whetting, mold very neatly, once scraped, for lead. It is
commonly slate-colored. One frequently brings them to
Toulouse from around Carcassonne .
