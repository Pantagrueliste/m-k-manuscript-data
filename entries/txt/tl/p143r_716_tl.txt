Molders from Foix

Those who mold crosswise make their sand with
crocum & calcined slate, but slate
always retains its asperity & becomes porous, because it is fat.
En noyau, it is not good, in sand, it can be accomodated.
They sieve their sand, grind it on porphyry,
and wet it in water, & they take away the finest, which is on
top, then reheat it.
