For sowing melons well, one needs it to be the end of a
moon cycle for otherwise they would bud too many leaves &
not bear enough fruit. Make small e holes, two
fingers by two fingers, with a pickaxe
& put in each two or three seeds. Next, take very fine
earth & fill the depressions lightly with it. Next, spread over
all to the thickness of a thumbhavets, that
is to say wheatfl chaff, in order that the
coming rain does not beat the earth & prevent their birth.
Havets attract field mice who eat the seeds. And
for avoiding this, one must moisten them with s a
decoction of wormwood.
