Softening

To soften well, one ought not to layer the colors thickly, but
rather layer them twice, except for azur dâ€™esmail.



All colors that have no body in oil have none in
distemper, and but in distemper they sink to
the bottom. Distemper colors want to be greasy, which is
recognized when they gel on the palette once distempered in
oil.
