For gilding on wood

First one needs to lay down a coat of glue very clear, and
once dry, you will lay down a coat of yellow gold. And when it is
done, you will take fig tree wood, & put it to soak
some space of time, & wash the places you want to gild, and
cut your gold with a knife to the price that you will
lay down. And one must lay down the said gold with
cotton. And if you can find some fig tree,
take the the white of one egg & stir it vigorously.



If your gold does not have beautiful enough color, you will take
a partridge feather, & make it burn it in a
chafing-dish, and make the smoke go against what you have
gilded.
