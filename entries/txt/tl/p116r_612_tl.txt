Molding deen noyau with the same
sand, wax images or lead medals and suchlike

Check if they release well. If they do not, fill with wax
what does not, and then anoint your images of wax or of
lead with olive oil, very thinly & very
lightly, such that the oil makes no thickness nor body on the
medal. Then, heat a little eau-de-vieuntil & when it is lukewarm, moisten the oiled
medal with it, for if it is the water were cold, it
would reject the oil, it would not set well. Next, cast your sand
of plaster, brimatton, &
wet alum on top. Having arranged your image on the claymandore & having made a circle around it
de to give it the necessary thickness. These medals
are oiled and rubbed thus with eau-de-vie
because they are firm & hard & would not be malleable for taking
out of the elamold, which is
tenacious, as are the natural animals, which are soft &
flexible.




When you have wetted your sand, do not cast it in the middle of the
mold, but on the sides, so that the sand descends gently, and
that the beginning is not thick & afterwards thick. If your wetted sand
sounds like water falling in the mold, it is a sign that
is too thin. Make it therefore of average thickness.
