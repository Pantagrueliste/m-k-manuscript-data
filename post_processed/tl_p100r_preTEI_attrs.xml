<head>Gold color</head>

<ab>To quickly make a layer of <fr><m>or <del><fr>sur</fr></del>
mat</m></fr> on <m>canvas</m> or other <m>oil panel</m>, one makes fatty
<m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> <env>in the sun</env> or <env>on the
fire</env>, as said above, for it thickens by itself in this way,
although there is neither <m>lead</m>, nor <m>ceruse</m>. And with this,
grind <fr><m>massicot</m></fr>, <m>mine</m>, &amp; other desiccatives,
not <fr><m>verdet</m></fr> nor <m>orpiment</m>, for they cause the
<m>gold</m> to die. It will be dry soon. However, if the
<env><tmp>weather is not clear &amp; dry</tmp></env>, do not shade it,
for if the <env><tmp>weather is damp &amp; humid</tmp></env>, it would
turn black.</ab>

<head>Portrait-painting from nature</head>

<ab>One needs to carefully <sn>observe</sn> the eyes, the nose, &amp;
the beard, for these three things make strong resemblance.</ab>

<head><m>Gemstones</m></head>

<ab>One needs to pestle your materials in a <tl>mortar</tl> of thick
<m>glass</m>,&amp; encased &amp; stuck with <m>mastic</m> into another
<tl>mortar</tl> of <m>wood</m> in order that it does not break, this can
serve for <pro>perfumers</pro>, &amp; the <tl>pestle</tl> also of

<head>Vitrified <m>saltpeter</m></head>

<ab>

Being melted with <m>pebbles</m>, it makes the <m>glass</m> very white.
But before, one needs to calcine it on a hot tile or <tl>coal
shovel</tl>. And that which will remain from the vapor, mix it as much
of the white calcined <m>pebbles</m>. It is true that, in the little
<tl>fourneau</tl>, it is not clarified well. But for large glass, it
makes the <m>glass</m> very clear &amp; white &amp; clean.</ab>

<head>Windows through which the <env>sun</env> will not pass</head>

<ab>Take the aforementioned <m>calcined saltpeter</m> &amp; expose it to
a <env>humid air or place</env>, and it will convert itself into a
liquid which, if rubbed <add>on both sides</add> of the windows, the
<env>sun</env> will not pass through; rather, it will give shade. One
needs to put the <m>saltpeter</m> on some clean <del>thing</del>
<add>place</add>, &amp; <del>it</del> put <tl>glowing coals</tl> on it,
and continue all over until it no longer burns.</ab>

It also serves for melting &amp; for adding in with <m>alkali salt</m>
for cleaning <bp>hands</bp>.</ab>
