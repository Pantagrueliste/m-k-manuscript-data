<head>Molding fruits and animals in sugar</head>

<ab><m>Sugar</m> is fatty when runny and brittle &amp; breakable when
dry, and with it, one casts well round things &amp; large muscles, but
awkwardly things fine &amp; delicate. However, try well clarified
<m>sugar</m>. One needs to soak for one night or one day the plaster
mold before casting the sugar, in order that is very full of water &amp;
does not drink the syrup. One needs also for it to be of easy release,
for the sugar is sour &amp; brittle. Finally, do not consider casting
anything in sugar that does not release well and that cannot be neatly
molded in two halves, to open it when you will need to. If you want to
mold a bunch of grapes, one needs to take it, like any other fruit, in
its true vigor, for if it is withered, it will <del>ne</del> come out
that way. Take heed, therefore, to make your molds in the natural season
of all things. The grapes, that are usually wanted cast in sugar, can be
made artificially or with wax or earth, or even with some grapes
attached with some melted wax on some slab &amp; other full thing, so
that they are very close together and when released &amp; only make up
one half. Or, if you have some of those grapes called chauches or
sauvignons, which have the grapes very close together, encase half of
them <del>sur</del> in the slab of clay and cast on the other half. And
if some of the grapes are not released, pluck them out. Note that
neither in sugar, nor in metal, can a bunch which has light &amp;
separated grapes be cast properly, because the end of the bunch is so
delicate, especially if you keep the bunch, that it could not withstand
the large grapes. Thusly, you will need to cast hollow, which you could
not do if the bunch does not have close grapes &amp; <del>molds</del>
without having them scattered &amp; spread apart.</ab>

<mark/>+ To cast pears and apples in <m>sugar</m>, one ought
not make any gates, but rather, fill one half of the mold and then join
the two, and keep turning it until the sugar has set and is cold. One
ought to mix nothing in the mold apart from plaster, reheated as you
know.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">



One needs for the mold to have soaked one day and one night in cold
water <del>for</del>, and to be humid, when you cast in sugar.</ab>

<ab margin="left-bottom">



The sign that the <m>syrup</m> or the <m>sugar</m> melted in water is
cooked enough to cast fruits, is when it makes threads when shook. And
if it passes that point, it is not good, for it will always be humid. If
the sugar attaches to it, one needs to throw some wheat starch in the
mold, or to rub it with an almond.</ab>
