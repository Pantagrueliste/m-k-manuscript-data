<head><m>Plaster</m> for molding</head>

<ab>When it is long to set and dry, it means that it is too fat and
moist, which is what makes it shrink away from the fire and crack.
<x>This is</x> where burrs come from. The one that comes from lean
<m>earth</m> is better. You must not store your moulds made of fat
<m>plaster</m> for a long time, because they resemble fat <m>earth</m>,
which when drying, cracks. The best is to reheat them soon after they
have been made and cast. Moulds made of good <m>plaster</m> can be
stored a long time.</ab>

<ab>You could make some marks according to the form of their scales,
making some bigger ones and some smaller ones, according to the shape of

attach it with small <m>iron</m> or <m>steel</m> nails, and glue it with
some <m>mouth glue</m>, then cover the whole thing with gray or black
<m>wax</m>. But it is necessary to let the <m>glue</m> dry for one day
