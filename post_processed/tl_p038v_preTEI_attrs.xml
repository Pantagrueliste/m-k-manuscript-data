<head>Merchants </head>

<ab>Those who retail velvet and other materials do not keep double-entry
books because they sell in small quantities and <sup>recording</sup>
these details would be too much effort. They only have their sales book
and account books. But those who sell in bulk and those who traffic in
woad have a double-entry book.</ab>

<head>Scarlets</head>

<ab>Because one <ms><fr>aulne</fr></ms> costs seven or eight
<cn>lb.</cn> to <m>dye</m>, they use <m>cloths</m> worth seven or eight
<cn>francs</cn> an <ms><fr>aulne</fr></ms>. But whoever wants something
beautiful <del><fr>se la</fr></del> should buy <m>white cloth</m> worth
fifteen <cn>francs</cn> an <ms>aulne</ms> &amp; have it <m>dyed</m> with
<m>pure scarlet <pa>pastel</pa></m> &amp; a little <m>cochineal</m>.
<m>Black cloth</m> comes thin because the <m>dyeing</m> is
inexpensive.</ab>
