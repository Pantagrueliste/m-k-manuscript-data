<ab>If your <tl>molds</tl> are of good <m>plaster</m> which withstands
well the fire<del>&amp;</del>, they will not crack at all, especially
if, with presses, they are well squeezed well between two tablets or in
a <tl>vessel</tl> filled with <m>ashes</m> or sand, &amp; in this way
they will make any flaws. But if they do make some, you can remove them
with a <tl>burin</tl> that one calls <fr><tl>chaple</tl></fr>, which has
a tip like a small <tl>chisel</tl>.</ab>
