continue without delay to put all the rest which is at the bottom, &amp;
a little thicker than the top, until everything is filled, up to the
mark for thickness that you made.

&amp; enters well everywhere. Also tip your <tl>mold</tl> up on the side
of the head, which is higher than the body, and thus your <tl>mold</tl>
will have the same thickness, &amp; you will spare <m>sand</m>. All of this
being carefully done <del><fr>fai</fr></del>, let it set, which will
take a <ms><tmp>quarter of an hour</tmp></ms>. Then release the
<m>clay</m> circle, which can be used another time. And leave it to dry
a little bit, &amp; separate your <tl>mold</tl> from the

cleanly thus. And do not forget to make notches around, in order that the
second cast anchors itself there &amp; binds better
