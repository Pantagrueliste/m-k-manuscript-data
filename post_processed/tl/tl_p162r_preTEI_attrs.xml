It can be gathered from the words of <pn>Herodotus</pn> that the
navigation of the <pl>Portuguese</pl> was not newly invented by them as
they brag. At the beginning of the first book entitled <gk>Clio</gk>, he
says that the <pl>Phoenicians</pl> would come from the <pl>Red Sea</pl>
by continuous navigation to the <pl>coast of Greece</pl>, mainly to
<pl>Argos</pl>, to which they would carry merchandise from
<pl>Egypt</pl> &amp; from <pl>Assyria</pl>, which they usually sold out
of within 6 <tmp>days</tmp>.</ab>

<pn>Herodotus</pn>, on the first page of <gk>Clio</gk>, says that the
<pl>Greeks</pl> were on a long ship on the <pl>coast of Colchis</pl>
&amp; to the <pl>river Phasis</pl>, whence they carried off
<pn>Medea</pn>.</ab>

<ab>As <pro>small peddlers</pro> lay open small wares in order to buy
richer ones &amp; to profit more and more, so I, from a desire to learn,
am exposing what little is in my <env>workshop</env> to <del>have
it</del> receive, through a common commerce of letters, much rarer
secrets from my benevolent <pro>readers</pro>.</ab>

<ab> Once finely pulverized, it molds very neatly &amp; has a certain
fatness that gives it binding <mark>|</mark>, more than
<m><la>crocum</la></m>, &amp; I believe that it would not be
inappropriate for a cast.</ab>

<ab> <m>The one which is white, light like a sponge</m>, once burned in
a closed fire, can be used for a <tl>frame</tl> for <m>lead</m>, and
molds very neatly. But such things do not endure fire.</ab>
