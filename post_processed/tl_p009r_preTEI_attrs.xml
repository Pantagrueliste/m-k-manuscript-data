<ab>Because <pa><fr>millet</fr></pa> is naturally very dry,
<pro>harvesters</pro> beat it most often <tmp>at night <env>in the cool
&amp; by moonlight</env></tmp>. Which could not be done with another
<pa>grain</pa> that is wetter, for one <del>le</del> must let the
sunbeams pass through, and one scarcely beats it until the <tmp>sun is
approaching midday</tmp>. Quickly after the <pa><fr>millet</fr></pa> is
cut, one needs to plow the earth because the root eats &amp; thins it as
much as if the <pa><fr>millet</fr></pa> was still standing. The ground
where the <pa><fr>millet</fr></pa> will have been sown is quite
diminished of its fertility <del>&amp; c</del>, which one knows
<del>well</del> <tmp>at the next sowing</tmp> that one makes. But above
all the <m>grain</m> called <pa><fr>pomole</fr></pa> in <pl>Gascony</pl>
or <pa><fr>baillard</fr></pa> in <pl><sup>northern</sup> France</pl>,
makes, according to the common saying, the earth shake seven
<tmp>years</tmp> later. <pa>Beans</pa> improve &amp; enrich the soil, as
long as one lets the roots &amp; stems rot in it.</ab>

<ab>They commonly have four books. The <fr>tyrant</fr>, which is a
formulary for apprentices, by which they can know how much every item of
merchandise costs &amp; for how much it should be sold. The second is
the waste book, where they put down in rough what they sell daily. The
third is the sales book, where they reduce to clean copy and put the
detailed account of what is contained in the waste book. The fourth is
the account book, which mentions the sale, the balanced account, the
bill &amp; the term of payment, &amp; this book is taken as evidence in
court.</ab>
