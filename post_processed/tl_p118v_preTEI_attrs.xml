<head>Casting in <tl>frames</tl></head>

<ab>The same sand that was used in the reheated <fr>noyaulx</fr>,
composed, as is said, of <m>plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> &amp; <m><fr>alum
de plume</fr></m> , is excellent for casting in <tl>frames</tl>, and I
have experienced it thus: I crushed the pieces which had come out of
molds <fr>en noyau</fr> in a <tl>mortar</tl>, dragging the
<tl>pestle</tl>, because this sand is very <fr>doulx</fr>. I did not
pass it through the <tl>sieve</tl>, because the <m><fr>alum de
plume</fr></m> mixed throughout, which binds it, would not pass; but I
ground finely upon <tl>marble</tl> what seemed to me too coarse. And
having prepared it thus, I moistened it with <m>sal ammoniac water</m>,
made of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, as much as the size of two
<ms><pa>walnuts</pa></ms>, in a bottle of <m>common water</m>, the same
size as a <tl>bottle</tl> in which one boils <m>tisane</m>, or in a good
<tl>pot</tl> of <m>water</m> so that you find the <m>water</m>
moderately salty. I mixed throughout <del><m>water</m> of</del> half a
<ms>glass</ms> of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, <del>two othe</del> two <del>au
t</del> <tl>silver spoonfuls</tl> of <m><fr>eau de vye</fr></m>.
<del>J’a</del> Having thus moistened the sand in such a way that it took
hold well, nevertheless coming apart easily, I sprinkled my medal with
<m>pulverized charcoal</m> with a <tl>file</tl>, to rid it of
<m>oil</m>, and all other <m>grease</m>, that are necessary to avoid,
for they <del>make</del> would hinder a good release. I blew on my medal
&amp; molded it, and the female part of the <tl>frame</tl> once filled,
I marked &amp; made a line on the reverse <del>of the</del> &amp; edge
of the medal, &amp; on the nearby sand as well. In order that the second
<tl>frame</tl> <del>s’em</del> take the imprint thereupon to denote the
place for making the cast, <del>once filled</del><del>the female part of
the box mold once filled</del> I uncovered the outline of the medal and
pounced the whole side with <m>pulverized charcoal</m>, and then filled
the male part with sand. <del>Once mad</del> I separated the
<tl>frame</tl> and did not hit the corners of the <del>d</del> medal to
make it release, because that knocks the sand &amp; makes it
<del>esp</del> crumble. Rather I struck the back of the <tl>frame</tl>,
retaining the obverse of the medal on the bottom, and it molded very
neatly. If it had not stripped thus, I would have waited to remove it
until the <tl>frames</tl> had been dried out over fire. I lit
<del>the</del> a row of <m>charcoals</m> between two little
<tl>trivets</tl> of <m>iron</m> in the form that you see, and put the
back <del>the</del> &amp; reverse of the <tl>frames</tl> thereupon,
&amp; the imprint on top, <figure id="fig_p118v_1" link="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-oNrvWdlO5Rm5qaUJCNWVFWlk">

because in this way, they dry out gently. And if, by chance, they should
crack from being too moistened, it is on the back,which <del>pr</del>
takes the harshest fire, &amp; the imprint remains safe &amp;
whole.</ab>

For the best, one needs to reheat the sand used in the <fr>noyau</fr>
before using it in the <tl>frames</tl>, until it no longer
contracts.</ab>

<man>

Excellent sand</man>

<ab>Take a little of the same sand, the finest that you can, to cover
the medal with.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

For medals &amp; flat things, the true heat of <m>lead</m> &amp;
<m>tin</m> is when it is melted gently.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

Note that I filled the <tl>frame</tl> before pressing it, and did not
hit it at all, but rather pressed it only with the strength of my
<bp>hands</bp>, because hitting it makes it go awry. Secure your
<tl>frame</tl> that it does not shift at all, &amp; if you put some
moistened sand under it, it will only hold in place more firmly.</ab>

<ab margin="left-bottom">

Make the gate so that it is not too thick, so as not to overcharge the
medal, but wide enough near the medal that it embraces a third part. Do
not forget the vents.</ab>

<ab margin="left-bottom">

To dry <tl>frames</tl> is to keep them from humidity, so that they no
longer smoke, once nevertheless having been very hot.</ab>

<df><fr>Recuire</fr></df> is to redden the frame, which is done for
<m>gold</m> and for <m>silver</m>.</ab>
