<ab>The large canon, which is for great batteries, usually weighs fifty
five or lx <ms>quintal</ms>s. At the breech it carries the thickness of
two balls &amp; a third of one ball. At the front, it carries the
thickness of one ball &amp; two thirds. It is thirteen or fourteen
<fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> in length. But they are very troublesome to
drive. The droicte battery, for having quickly exploicté &amp; battre of
great force is from hundred fifty paces &amp; of two hundred. And it is
true that one bat well from three or 4 hundred <ms>pace</ms>s, but it is
necessary to give it more <m>powder</m>. Its common load is of xx
<ms>lb</ms> of <m>powder</m>, its ball of 40 <ms>lb</ms>. One needs xxv
<al>horses</al> to drag it. When one drags it farther than its usual
range, one puts in a half <ms><tl>linstock</tl></ms> of canon
<m>powder</m> more. A canon can be shot 80 or a hundred shots per day,
but one needs to refresh it every time after one has shot nine or ten
shots, if the battery is continuously used; if there are some breaks, it
is not necessary to refresh it as often. For each <ms>quintal</ms> of
<m>copper</m> - or one <ms>quintal</ms> and a half for big cannons - a
<ms>quintal</ms> of <m>metal</m> is added. The <m>metal</m> is composed
of eight <ms>pound</ms>s of <m>tin</m> for each <ms>quintal</ms> of
<m>rosette</m> and even less for big bells for which we use only six
<ms>pound</ms>s of fine <m>tin</m> for a <ms>quintal</ms> of
<m>rosette</m>, to give it a louder voice. Because the more <m>tin</m>
there is, the clearer the sound is. For canon founding, if the material
and <m>charcoal</m> is provided as it is usually done because
<pro>master</pro>s cannot afford it, it costs 10 to 12 <cn>pound</cn>s
per <ms>quintal</ms>. And when the <pro>master</pro> provides
everything, you give him 40 <cn>pound</cn>s per <ms>quintal</ms> for big
pieces such as cannons, according to the King's ordinance. And 50
<cn>pound</cn>s for smaller pieces. For the more matter there is, the
more the <pro>master</pro> makes profit. Another kind of 30
<ms>quintal</ms>'s fowler is founded which is longer than the others,
and usually 8 <fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long, which is used to attack
fortifications and <fr>cassemattes</fr> by displaying them, at night, in
groups on the moat's edge.</ab>

Each side of the breech's opening is half a cannonball thick, plus a
third of a cannonball.</ab>

<ab>We give it two <ms><tl>linstock</tl></ms> of cannon <m>powder</m>
for its load, and half a <ms><tl>linstock</tl></ms> of arquebus
<m>powder</m> and the same for the others.</ab>

The alloy of cannons from <pl>France</pl> is made of one
<ms>quintal</ms> of metal for two of <m>rosette</m>. But those of
<pl>Toulouse</pl> and <pn>Ponce</pn>t put 3 <ms>quintal</ms>s of
<m>rosette</m> for one of metal.</ab>

<ab> The <m>rosette</m> used to remelt is better than <m>rosette</m> for
cauldrons, for the latter get all dirty.</ab>

<ab margin="left-bottom">



The older pieces are composed of almost as much of each, that is to say
a part of <m>rosette</m> and one of metal. This alloy can be recognized
with a <tl>burin</tl> because the matter is acid and the part scraped
off with the <tl>burin</tl> is yellow and white.</ab>
