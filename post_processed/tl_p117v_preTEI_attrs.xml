<head>To make the ashes of <pa>flowers</pa> and <pa>plants</pa> leave
<tl>molds</tl></head>

<ab>Some <del>mix</del> put <m>quicksilver</m> inside it. But, if it is
a little work, or fine &amp; delicate foliage, that only has
<del>p</del> a slender exit, they make two errors: the first, that
<m>quicksilver</m> by its heaviness can break <del>f</del> some delicate
feature inside when shaken, the other, that some grains will always
linger inside that will make <m>metals</m> sour &amp; hinder the
perfection of the cast. It is true that if it is to empty the
<tl>mold</tl> of some animal which is large &amp; which has big conduits
&amp; passages by which the <m>quicksilver</m> can easily exit, like a
bird or a serpent, one can indeed put in it some
<m>quicksilver<del>pou</del></m> to break by shaking the calcined bones
of the animal, because the aforesaid <m>â˜¿</m> will come out &amp; not
remain at all.</ab>

<ab margin="left-top">

The <pa>asparagus</pa> stalk is so hard that most often it remains as
charcoal. Because of this, dry it out beforehand, or wet it with <m>oil
of sulfur</m> &amp; <m>turpentine</m>, or cast separately the little
branches &amp; solder them onto a fat stalk drawn through the wire
drawing plate.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

If the burnt thing has left some filth or ash, let it cool a little,
&amp; with an <m>iron</m> <m>wire</m> wrapped in <m>cotton</m> that can
bend according to the cavities that you have to search out, clean &amp;
blow out this defect, or with a soft <tl>brush</tl> or a clipped
<tl>pinceau</tl>.</ab>

<head><pa>Daisies</pa></head>

<ab>They can be cast well in <m>gold</m>. But if you want to
<m>enamel</m> them, you have to make them by hand &amp; <m>enamel</m>
them &amp; then attach them. Otherwise, the <pa>leaves</pa> would be so
pressed together that the enamel would muddle together there. </ab>

<div id="p117v_a3">

<head><m>Sand</m> that was used</head>

<ab>Do not cast it. But because it is mixed with <m>alum de plume</m>,
you can use it in the mixture of other things &amp; it can serve in
place of <m>brick</m>.</ab>

<head>Molding <fr>en noyau</fr> figures of <m>wax</m> or medals or
<m>lead</m></head>

<ab>Rub them with <m>oil</m> with a <tl>pinceau</tl>, but let it be so
lightly that your medal is almost rubbed dry &amp; that it hardly
appears to have been smeared. After <del>destr</del> rub it with <m>eau
de vye</m> and heat the <m>water</m> with which you will wet your
aforementioned <m>sand</m>, with <m>plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> &amp;
<m>alum</m>, in order that being <del>chau</del> like lukewarm when you
cast it, the <m>oil</m> will not refuse it, as it does with cold water,
&amp; do not forget when moistening your <m>sand</m> to always mix in it
a little <m>sal ammoniac</m>.</ab>

Medals <tl>mold</tl> in such a way very neatly.</ab>

<head><m>Blood of snakes</m></head>

<ab>If you need to cut some snake inside the <tl>mold</tl> to burn it,
cut it far from the entrance of the <tl>mold</tl> in order that no
<m>blood</m> at all remains, for it would make a crust that afterwards
would not be taken away by the same <m>quicksilver</m> &amp; would
remove the imprints from your <tl>mold</tl>.</ab>
