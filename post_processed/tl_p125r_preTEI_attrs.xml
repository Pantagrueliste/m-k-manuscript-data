<ab>&amp; from these conduits &amp; <fr>abrevouers</fr>, you can also
put there small threads of <m>wax</m>, which are joined to the body, in
order that the <m>metal</m> goes more easily from one part to another

gates &amp; your vents without spoiling anything.</ab>

From small rolls, you make your gates and vents without danger of
crusting &amp; removing anything from the mold, because the wax, being
taken away, leaves the empty space all made. Make your vents coming from
the head, which is in the bottom, towards the gate. Make also your gate
so that it is <del>too</del> but little thick, and make within its
course two or three notches, for this breaks up the fury of
the<m>metal</m> and makes it flow with ease, without bubbling nor making
too much smoke, which hinders its run. You can divide it also in two or
three branches thus

<head><m>Plaster</m></head>

<ab>When you <del>v</del> mold something to cast <m>wax</m> in it, you
mold in plaster alone, reheated after having been pulverized. For, once
reheated in <m>stone</m>, the outside is cooked, and the inside stays
almost raw. Transparent grey <m>plaster</m> is not strong, but a good
one, is one, that, once wet, is white &amp; sets very quickly. However,
the grey I have found to be quite firm, &amp; hard after having set, but
its takes longer to do so. One needs to know the nature of each. <del>
If you</del> You will never mold very neatly if
<corr><del>ne</del></corr> you do not wet, very thin &amp; liquid, your
plaster or your sand for <fr>noyau</fr>. Wet it
<del><tl>mortar</tl></del> quickly after it has been reheated.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

If you mold with <m>plaster</m> <del>crud</del> alone, reheat it
nevertheless as said. One needs to oil well the first mold. And when the
second one has set well, and it is ready, soak it for a long time in
water. And if it does not want to release, soak it in hot <m>water</m>,
for cold <m>water</m> hardens it, and hot <m>water</m> softens it
further. Cold water does not penetrate it like it does with mixed
plaster, because it is harder &amp; the mixed one is more spongy. With
this plaster, thus reheated as powder, one can cast medals that do not
fear the rain, especially if they are varnished. One can find these in
Germany, on the houses. But take heed that the water be very hot, &amp;
if it is boiling, there is no danger. All plaster molds, pure or mixed,
release in it. </ab>

<head>Scimitars</head>

<ab>THe <pro>workers</pro> from Damascus or from Hungary, neighbors to
the Turks, separate, in the mine, <m>iron</m> from <m>steel</m>. And,
from this first steel, melted when it is first mined, they cast in sand
the <del>sab</del> blades of the scimitar, that after, cut the other
iron without any difficulty, because any melted iron is harder than
<fr>douls</fr> iron beated in pigs &amp; bars. Thus is the <m>steel</m>
of scimitars, but it is quite brittle. When one takes off the hilt of a
scimitar, one recognizes by the tip that enters the hilt that is cast in
<m>sand</m>.</ab>
