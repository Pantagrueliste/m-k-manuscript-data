<head>Moulds</head>

<ab>They are less prone to cracking while reheating when they are very
thick, rather than thin, provided that thickness is sufficient. Because
when they are thin, they do not need to be fired for long, and prolonged
exposure to heat corrupts them. The same thing will happen if you
<m>plaster</m> is not strong.</ab>

<ab>It is better to reheat one mold on its own, rather than heating it
with others, because should this be the case, you will need a stronger
and hotter fire, than for just the one <sup>mold</sup>. And because
<m>charcoal</m> will accumulate between multiple molds, the heat will
transfer from mold to mold in such a way that you will often find that
your molds have burst and crack on one side more than the other.</ab>

<ab>Therefore reheat your molds, not applying fire, except to cover
it.</ab>

<ab>And because your <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m> become brittle when
melting the over high heat, in order to make them less brittle, heat
them over low heat, and cast in stick form.</ab>

<ab>Brick cools the <m>metal</m>, and if this is not for binding, it is
not necessary.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">The reheated moulds cannot withstand
several casts, but the ones in which you only cast <m>tin</m> or
<m>lead</m> and flat medals, these being dry, withstand a lot of
casts.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle"><m>Iron filings</m> being finely ground,
makes them <sup>molds</sup> very firm and strong.</ab></div>.
