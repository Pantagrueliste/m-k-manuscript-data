<ab>Your lute once dry, put, in the early morning, your crucible in a
<fr>four à vent</fr>, &amp; at the beginning, give slow fire, as much
for reheating your crucible than for gently letting the fury of the
<m>saltpeter</m> pass. Then, invigorate little by little &amp; with
judgment the fire. And <del>y</del> leave in the fire’s full vigor, your
substances, for 12 hours, or a natural day. Make each time a good
quantity of this substance, to not repeat it often, because the fumes,
which are dangerous, could hurt you. And before working at it, take in
the morning good buttered toast, and hold the said <m>butter</m>, or
<m>zedoary</m>, or <m>gold</m> coins, in your mouth, and <del>ada</del>
cover your face with a cloth from the eyes down. From this mass, the
crust will serve you <del>make run</del> to clear <del>the great works
of</del> the <m>silver</m> from the metallic mass <del>like
<al>snakes</al> &amp; similar things</del> when it starts to melt.
<del>But</del> And then, the grain that will be at the bottom of the
<tl>crucible</tl> should be put aside for <del>principally delicate
flowers and herbs</del> putting a little in the melted <m>silver</m>
when you want to cast it, <del>However is it necessary to always put a
little of this grain in the <m>silver</m> when <del>you want to
cast</del> it is well melted and when you are ready to cast</del>.
Thusly, do as you make fine <m>tin</m> on <m>copper</m>, &amp; for
<m>looking-glass tin</m> on <m>lead</m> and on <m>tin</m>. And, just as
<m>looking-glass tin</m> sours <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m> too much, if
you put it in too great a quantity, likewise, the grain composed of the
above-mentioned substances would sour your silver if <del>l</del> you
were to put in too much, and obscure it. This above-mentioned
composition will suffice you for a long time, when it has been for a
whole day on a <del>gentle</del> gentle fire at the beginning &amp;
invigorated degree by degree until the end. Then, having given it one
load of charcoal, let it consume it by itself, &amp; let your
<tl>crucible</tl> cool. Next, break it. You will find two hard slabs
&amp; <fr>tourtelles</fr> in the <tl>crucible</tl>. The upper one is
like petrified <del>Once</del>, composed of <m>salts</m> sublimated
&amp; mixed together. The lower one is metallic, composed of fillings,
<m>aes ustum</m> &amp; <m>antimony</m>, having the grain very small.
Pulverize the upper <fr>tourtelle</fr>, made from <m>salts</m>, &amp;
put some to clear &amp; clean the <m>silver</m>, and the metallic grain
can be used to put in the melted metal.</ab>

Or, after you have had your <m>drugs</m> pestled by a peasant. And
having put them in your crucible, &amp; the latter luted &amp; dry as
said &amp; placed into the furnace, have the fire managed by a shop boy,
familiar with <m>charcoal</m>. </ab>

One sells well to silversmiths this metallic mass to soften their
solder, because when melting, <m>latten</m> exhales. And with a little
of this substance, they solder over the other solder.</ab>
