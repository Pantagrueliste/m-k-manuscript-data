<head>For casting</head>

<ab>If you have some piece which does not want to release, &amp; is big,
mold it with <m>wax</m>, either in cavity or in relief, because it is
malleable once soft &amp; obeys, and thus separates itself from the
piece without leaving anything. But take heed that the <m>melted wax</m>
be neither too hot nor too cold. Some mold with <m>wax</m> heated in
<m>hot water</m>, but in pressing the <tl>mold</tl>, it becomes gauche
&amp; becomes fake. Once your cavity in <m>wax</m>, you can cast in some
<m>very soft clay</m> &amp; very moistened &amp; clear, &amp; let it dry
at ease. Then you will make a cavity on it <del><fr>ave</fr></del> of
<m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>, in <del><fr>tu</fr></del> which what you will
form will be of good release.</ab>

thickness and attach feathers as for a cittern or a spinet &amp; arrange
them according to the song you want it to play, leaving a suitable
distance. And, turning the axle either by yourself or by a clock spring,
your invention will effect itself.</ab>
