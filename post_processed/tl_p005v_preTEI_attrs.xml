<ab>string &amp; will reflect a <bp>nipple</bp> as large as a plate, and
women can see the secret places that they do not want to show to
<pro>surgeons</pro>. It casts the representation out of itself, and if
you touch the eye of the representation with your <bp>finger</bp>,
another <bp>finger</bp> will come against yours.</ab>

<ab>You will make a light at night for someone quite far away, if you
place the concave mirror behind a candle placed on the window. You can
read and write quite far from the candle if you place it behind the
candle &amp; place &amp; turn the concavity towards you. If you put the
mirror at the end of a table &amp; a candle on it, it will represent two
lights on the table for you. To see what is happening on a street,
shutter the window, and the more you can shut there the better. Make a
hole at the lower <sup>pane</sup>, the size of your <ms><bp>little
finger</bp></ms>, perfectly round, from one side to the other. Then
place a sheet of paper on the window &amp; let the middle of the sheet
be over the hole. Pierce the sheet in the same place as the hole &amp;
the same size. After, aim the concave face of the mirror towards the
hole, &amp; it will represent for you anyone passing by in the street on
the sheet of paper. Similarly with the pierced door of a closed room.
You can make wavy ones &amp; triangular ones, of the sort described by
Ptolemy &amp; Archimedes. The concave one also sets fire to straw,
lights a candle from afar, using the sun. By reverberating fire too, it
heats.</ab>

half an ounce of <m>quicksilver</m>, and remove it all at once from the
