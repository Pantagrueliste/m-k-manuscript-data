<head>To shoot a gun without noise</head>

<ab>Warm up the barrel and close the lumiere d'embas, and take a piece
of the freshest <m><al>pork</al>suint</m> that you can find and as long
as the phalanx of your little finger and the size of the diameter of the
canon, and push it back and forth until it is completely melted. Then,
load a cartridge which fits on the top of the barrel, as you know, and
it will only make a little whistling.</ab></div>

<head>Dipping for a bullet that will reach far away and will compromise
the healing</head>

<ab>Mix some <m>suint</m> and strong <m>vinegar</m> and dip the bullet
in this mixture while it is still hot.</ab></div>

<head>Against wounds</head>

<ab>Cut a <al>chicken</al> or a <al>dog</al> to test &amp; put
<m>sap</m> &amp; <m>pestled herb which is called
<pa><df><la>semperviva</la></df></pa></m> in the wound. It is the kind
which has leaves like small grains which some call
<m><pa><la>vermicularis</la></pa></m>. And one takes for granted that it
will not die.</ab></div>
