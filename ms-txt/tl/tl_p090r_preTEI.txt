  Sal ammoniac and iron dross I have pulverized sal ammoniac, dried well in the fire &amp; in a hot bronze mortar, and passed it through the double sieve; it became very fine. But to render it even more delicate, I have ground it dry on porphyry. Then, I mixed it with pulverized &amp; finely ground iron dross, in the same way, and both mold very neatly things in low relief without being moistened in the serain, or in the cellar, or otherwise with the napkin, &amp; it releases very neatly.   Sand Molders from Foix who cast theireu medals crosswise, use crocum ferri and calcined slate. It is for very flat things.   That any sand can be rendered good Artisans who work in large works &amp; who need to further their profit by seeking things already prepared in nature, because she does not sell her wares to her children, and to also save the time they would use for grinding finely &amp; for artificially preparing sands, seek the one of the s mines, which is not too fatty, the one that is a kin of earth, not too lean &amp; consequently without bond, but rather that which is pulled from the depths of the sand-bed in bricks &amp; clods that show its natural compaction, which is quite difficult to break &amp; which has a very small &amp; delicate grain, &amp; which is found soft when handling it between the fingers. And because the latter is only found near the rocks in mountainous areas or lean territories, &amp; akin to the arene, it cannot be found in in the surroundings of all the bonnes villes where artisans willingly gather. And thus, if they do not have it close to their house, they prefer to have it come from afar, like from Lyon, Venice, Paris near the Sainct Chappelle &amp; similar places, rather than prepare it. However, you can be certain that in all places you can render the sand from a mine

However, you can be certain that in all places you can render the sand from a mine     good &amp; proper for molding. For if it is coarse, pass it through a sieve, and if it is not yet fine enough, wash it, &amp; when the water has rested a little, empty that which is still troubled in some separate vessel. The coarse will promptly fall down to the bottom of the first vessel, but the one which will have come from the troubled water, set apart, having settled, will be very fine. And then, if it does not have enough bond, grind it quite dry on porphyry, &amp; you will render it impalpable, &amp; which will have bond like chalk. Then, if it seems right to you, you will reheat it &amp; again will grind it &amp; mix it with salts, or linen, or burnt felt, or ashes of paper &amp; similarly washed things.   Terre fondue of potters Grind it in a mortar mustard mill with some water &amp; render it impalpable, dry it &amp; next moisten it with salt water, which gives strength to u all sands to withstand several casts.   Orange trees In Italy, those who are in the colder regions, like Lombardy, make square wooden cases, a little larger at the bottom than at the top, and affix buckles on its sides for transporting them with straps, as one carries gout sufferers, because the wheels with which one could make them roll spoil the pathways of the gardens. And every two years, they do not forget to open the sides of the cases for trimming &amp; dexterously cutting, with the soil, the ends of the orange treeâ€™s roots, because otherwise, as they find the wood, they contract &amp; fold back on themselves &amp; dry at the tips &amp; would make the tree die. But as they are trimmed, it preserves for them new space cosfor expanding, without finding resistance from the wood that hinders them. And know that, for this effect, it would be better to join the sides of the cases with screws &amp; not with nails, in order to not shake the soil when one opens them.
