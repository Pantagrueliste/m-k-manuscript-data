not to open your mold too hot, for this sours it, makes it

this makes the le met tin or lead
contract.




Mold made in two casts

It is opened, once reheated, to clean it; next, one puts the
clamps on again, one lutes the mold &amp;
especially the joints, then one slowly dries the earth. And then,
as it no longer smokes, one leaves the mold to cool until you can
hold it without harm. Next, put in the presses or in the sand
in a terrine, &amp; cast in tin. For if you
were to cast in silver or gold, it would be necessary that
your mold be reheated twice &amp; cast when it would be completely 
red.



If your mold f, through the fault of the
plaster, retracts in the fire, you need to open it
after the first reheating to tighten it again, &amp; clamp it
and lute again, and tighten again.




Method for reheating the molds

Light charcoals in the forge, &amp; then arrange
them in rows in a corner of it, according to the size of your
mold, in such a way that it can be furnished with three or 4
fingers all around, and especially at the bottom of
the mold, which is the thickest and which. Your
charcoals thus arranged, place your molds on top of
them, &amp; not on a grate, as some do, because they
would take the fire too harshly. And leave for some time thus, &amp;
little &amp; by little, warm your oven, always adding some lit
charcoal. And as long as the mold is damp, the
charcoals will be as if died down from below. But as it dries,
they will kindle by themselves. And when it is dry on one side, turn it to
the other. And when it is dry on both, &amp; it will no longer smoke. At
that moment, invigorate the fire &amp; cover it with lit
charcoals. And as it will begin to redden, do not blow the
charcoals with the little bellows, for this would make it
blow burst. And similarly, when it is red, keep it well
covered with lit charcoals &amp; do not uncover it, for it would
crack. Make sure wind from a window does not beat upon it. Let
cool



When you want to reheat your molds, &amp; be they
luted or not, mark on the belly the place to put at the bottom,
against the lit charcoals, que because if the
ardor of the fire were to make them crack, it would be better that this be
at the belly &amp; from underneath than on the back.



If your mold is small, one ought not to leave it
rest so much in the fire, for it corrupts and cracks there,
for it reheats more quickly than a big one.

But make sure, through the gate, that it is red at the bottom &amp; that
nothing appears black.




Common sand from the mine

In a frame, if one casts hot, it becomes porous; therefore,
one only needs to dry it out.


    



Crocum ferri

Having d passed it through vinegar &amp;
reddened it in the fire, I had it finely ground on porphyry,
until no roughness was perceived on the fingernail. Then,
I wet it with very good vinegar &amp; 
left it therea two or three days, stirring
it several times each day. Finally, I boiled it
&amp; reddened in the pot &amp;
crocum all together in the four Ã 
vent. It came back in a mass full of small bubbles, but that
can be pulverized very finely between the fingers. I
put some in the sand, a half as much as
feather alum. I tempered the sand quite thinly &amp; molded
out of it a very small female lizard, which molded very neatly &amp;
delicately &amp; very finely. The crocum ferri does not
render the mold harder, but it firms it. And when your
mold is soft &amp; fatty when scraping it with the
fingernail, it is a sign that the crocum is
good, very fine, &amp; well prepared. The quantity cannot spoil the
mold, because it is a friend to gold. And I believe that
silver would come out well. And that the mold, through
this means, does not crack. Make it from filings of
needles.


        
I have tried to make it so the molds where it is mixed do not crack
during reheating &amp; thus do not make flashing.
    

        
It is better made with distilled vinegar.



One can put some amongst the molds, where you want to cast
silver, for it firms the molds, and you will find it so,
by scraping a little harder than the other where there is none. It molds
very neatly.



This one is appropriate for all molds &amp; keeps them from
breaking &amp; bursting in the fire. And for flat medals, it withstands
several casts. The one of steel fillings &amp; needles is redder
&amp; better.




Gilding animals cast in silver

You can gild them with amalgam without spoiling any
of the features, if they are made of silver.
