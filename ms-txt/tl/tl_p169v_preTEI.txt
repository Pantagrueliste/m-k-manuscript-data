Molding very thin like bimbalotiers do

They mold in paper &amp;
carton, for neither earth, sand, nor
metal would mold as neatly &amp; would not receive. Or else they
engrave in stone from Istre the
principal side, &amp; the reverse is of paper or
carton.







Reducing a round figure to a hollow form

You need to first mold it with some plaster, as said
before, &amp; in the plaster cast in wax, from which will
come out a relief that you will repair very neatly, and
bmodel it as you fancy. And then you will model
this relief of wax again in plaster, or better yet, with
your wetted sand # like for noyau, &amp; in the
latter, cast in some lead, &amp; from this you will have a very
neat relief, &amp; if it is not, repair on the cement or
otherwise, &amp; take heed that it is always of good release. And
this one will always serve you well for making as many hollow forms as you
please, in this way. Place half of your figure of
lead, oiled &amp; wetted with eau-de-vie according
to the above, in the clay slab, then mold this half with
some white plaster. Having set next and having
well smoothed &amp; flattened the plaster, take your
black wax mixed with sulfur, as is said, because it leaves
nothing in the mold &amp; melts quicker. Wet it in warm
urine, &amp; once softened enough, make an imprint with it
on the half of the lead figure, and it you will have a
very neat hollow form. Shape next the hollow wax form in a square shape, as
you please, with sufficient thickness &amp; smooth it well on all sides,
&amp; thus next, mold this hollowed wax,
imprinted on one part &amp; flat &amp; smooth on the other, in the same
fashion that you mold flat medals of wax or other
metal en noyau. And the mold en noyau
will render in silver or such metal as pleases you
the m a similar figure to the wax, that is to
say flat &amp; smooth on one side &amp; hollow on the other. And having
cleaned &amp; put this hollow form to be whitened, if it is silver,
you will be able to mix there some works of sugar,

having made a hole in your clay slab &amp; having
en packed in it half of the figure of wax, 
a little oiled, to pull it out better.



Transparent wax is not good, but rather the one which has body,
to make an imprint well.

    











As you have molded with plaster &amp; wax one half, you
can mold the other the same.

perfume &amp; suchlike. But take heed that it is
necessary that the black wax with which you mold be
hard, in order that, quickly &amp; du more drily,
it retracts, in order to see if it is well imprinted. It is rendered
harder by adding into the already melted one more melted sulfur
&amp; a little rosin.







Currency medals

One makes the relief puncheons of untempered steel,
then one tempers them, &amp; with these one
strikes on matrices, not reddened in fire, as some think, but
on steeled iron, reheated &amp; softened, which one quenches afterward.








Casting

Do not cast in one go, for in doing so, the metal is
regurgitated &amp; in, &amp; the
metal gets cold before it goes down. But cast bit by bit &amp;
taking your time.







Clamps

When you put them back the second time, make sure that the
mold does not shift.







Molds

Those of noyau, in being reheated, want to be set on
charcoals a little spent, without the air touching
them, like the frame molds want to be recu
dried in the open &amp; uncovered.







Thick works of tin

They do not want to be cast in lead or red tin like
thin &amp; delicate things. It is enough if it is f
well melted &amp; hot. Thin things want to be quite hot &amp; of red
tin.







Cleaning closed molds

One needs to let them cool rather than blow inside to clean them,
for when hot, they retain the ash. When cold, they are cleaned better. Take a thin wire of latten or a delicate straw to clean the tail completely, for this is what makes the gate. Blow into it &amp; suck, drawing it to you. Before molding,
thicken the tail with wax, then cut it,

    









    







 &amp; join &amp; solder a tail of latten wire with
solder. The lumps on a flower are a small matter, for this can
be removed with the chaple, but let the leaves come
out well, then the paint covers everything.
