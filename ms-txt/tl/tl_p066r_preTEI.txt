The Flemish &amp; those who paint panels by the dozen only
make one layer &amp; finish at the first go, but the colors soon die.
And when they are layered twice, they do not die. One needs to layer

Or mat




        
It is made with massicot, minium, ocre de ru, 
&amp; yellow ochre, in order that the composition
resembles gold. Gild the day after un
jo it is laid down if you in the make the
seat for the color in the evening. After having gilded,
let it dry &amp; rest one day, next rub the gilding
with a feather &amp; cotton in order
that no protrusions remain, then varnish with Flanders
varnish, which you make mixed with a little eau-de-vie, to render it desiccative.



The varnish will be dry in an hour. It
will increase the color of gold. And this or mat holds
in the rain, even if one rubs it. But it must be well dried
for eight or ten days.



Gold color that is made of different colors cleaned from
paintbrushes for oil is not so good, &amp; with
time, tarnishes the gold because of the verdigris. One
must not touch with a finger the layer made for
the gold because that will keep it from attaching itself. The or
moulu is spoiled if water touches it, but the or
mat holds well in the rain &amp; in water.
One must not burnish it, because the tooth would remove it.
Gather the protrusions &amp; small flakes that the
cotton makes lift off when the gold is
dry &amp; you clean it, for an ounce is still gold. In
Flanders, women make gild. It is more
beautiful when it is a little thick, but in France they beat it
too delicately.



Breathe on the gold color, and if it fogs up, it is dry enough,
but if it does not receive the vapor of the breath, it is not
enough.


One ought not to gild with or mat after with
having gilded. But wait one day or one night, But
take heed not to and when it is as if dry, it grips the
gold. Next, one varnishes.




    

        

        
Painting in distemper on wood
        
Because it is very tedious to paint in distemper on
wood, and because one is at pains to make a good
a face on it, some thin their colors with glair of egg
passed through a sponge, or mixed with the yolk,
water, &amp; thoroughly beaten with the peelings of the fig
tree. With this

as with oil, and this supports the varnish, but this does
not last.
        

    

        

        
Colors in oil that are imbibed
        
It is best that colors in oil are imbibed, that is to say
they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if
in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the
oil has remained in that part, which would make the colors die.
The varnish mends all this &amp; unites &amp; renders it similar
in one place as in another.
        
It is necessary that gold color be laid down thick, for if it were clear, it
would be imbibed &amp; would run.
        
           
On canvas &amp; in distemper, one gilds with bole
&amp; honey &amp; a little garlic juice.

Next they pounce some moresque in the corners &amp; paint it

and a little yellow ochre, tempered with fatty oil
in which they clean their paintbrushes for oil,
because the three aforesaid colors are gripping &amp; dry immediately.
Next they lay down the gold, then varnish on top of all. And it
seems to some by this means that all this black is painted in
