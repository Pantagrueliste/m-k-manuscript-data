A fatty sand which is rendered very smooth, makes it porous.  A fatty metal needs lean sand.    Eau Magistra Some people think that salt water is not good, because the salt cracks in fire, &amp; consequently should make it porous. There is only the wine boiled with elm root. Charcoal for pouncing makes for a good release, but one finds that the one of willow makes it porous. The one of oak or beech does make it porous well without making it porous.  Try burnt oysters.   Lead For casting, there is only soft lead that wants to be cast very g hot, and soft tin.   Sand for lead, the most excellent of all, for high and low reliefs  I took ceruse and crushed it dry on porphyry to make it very fine, then I moistened so much with well-beaten glair of egg that it was like a paste, smoothing it perfectly with the dull side of a knife. I left it a little  X   One ought to mix it well with a knife.

I oiled my medal, because oil cleans it without spoiling it. And And having dried it &amp; cleaned it with a linen cloth &amp; very small hog bristle brushes, I once again lightly anointed it with clear walnut oil &amp; gently passed a linen cloth over it so that it does not remain too anointed, and I noted that, by this means, it would come out better in release, because the ceruse, once moistened with water of glair of egg, would not attach to the oil. This worked very well and I molded a medal of high relief very neatly, without any sticking, which a lot of good sands, such as felt, burnt bone &amp; iron dross, had failed to do on the first try. I reheated it &amp; my mold became hard like marble, and by this I knew that sands for molding high relief should be well moistened with some water, which gives them body &amp; compactness, such as glair, gummed water, ea wine boiled with elm root, &amp;c; and lightly oil the medal, it withstands as many castings as you wish, for it is as hard as glass. But even soft lead &amp; brittle tin v want to be cast very hot. Since then I have realized that this sand, even though it is excellent &amp; endures many castings &amp; molds very neatly, nevertheless is fatty and makes things porous. Thus, soft lead and the does not come out so well. But try to mix it with a lean sand, such as pumice, scales &amp; similar things to give them body &amp; so that they release better. For lean sands barely release well and yet they receive metal well.    Try to mix ceruse or minium with other sands.  X  Oil &amp; anoint with aspic oil, which will go away when reheating, for the oil makes it porous.  One ought to moisten with glair, then mix it well. And once in the frame, beat on top with a pestle, or other appropriate thing, for this makes it mold better and release better.   It would be good to fill the frame all at once, for the mixture that is made of several sands with that of the mine, with which you fill the frame, corrupts it.

Next, oil them &amp; keep them under the dung.   Glue The Flemish reglue their earthen pots with gold color, that is to say minium, massicot &amp; varnish.
