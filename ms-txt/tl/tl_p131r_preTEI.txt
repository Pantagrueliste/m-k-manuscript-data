Plants that are awkward to burn in the mold

Mold them with two or three casts, which, once reheated, will open,
&amp; it will be easier for you to take away the charcoal from
inside.



Trial




Letters and molded paper

Write with well gummed ink or with any color which has body
&amp; which does not erase once moistened with eau-de-vie.
Then, place your paper on a clay slab &amp;
moisten it with eau-de-vie and cast on one side &amp; the
other.




For adorning beds, mirrors, and
suchlike

Rough out some design in half relief on a quite flat
slate to adapt it to either round or flat things. And having
cast it in mixed tin, quite thin, you can gild it with
gold leaf &amp; adapt it to whatever you want, and fill the
vui bottom of the relief with small rubies,
orpiment &amp; little grains of diverse colors.





For teaching a dogei well

It is necessary to keep it tied up, &amp; when it does what you
command it, to make it love you, give it some cheese that has
been held under your armpit. Which must be a bad drug, &amp; for
the master, if he is red-haired, &amp; for the apprentice
too.





Molded waxes

Figures of wax composed of ceruse &amp; lead
white are not for burning &amp; melting in a mold where you
want to cast gold &amp; silver, for this would sour it.
And then, if you think about taking away these waxes composed of
things coming from the metals reheated in the mold, you
will be wrong, because, the asperity of the fire making them boil
ir, the wax goes away &amp; the composition
of the ceruse or other metallic color attacks the mold.

White wax is more delicate than the other &amp; it does not leave
any filth when you want to make noyau and mold

in a round form to cast it in gold and silver, put
only in your wax what you prepare for this effect
sino from all these drugs, except casting with
melted sulfur, since it is melted, &amp; candle
smoke. The melted sulfur goes to the bottom and nevertheless
leaves its quality in the wax, making it melt promptly in the fire
&amp; giving it firmness. In this way, you can melt in the fire this
roughed out ci figure of wax. But if it is
composed of ceruse or suchlike, it is necessary that you
put your mold in boiling water.



For figures of flat wax, there is no need for all this, for the
wax releases &amp; does not stay in the la
mold.




When the cast of tin or lead becomes porous



If your cast work has become porous, it can be repaired with very hard
wax which you can gild afterward with silver or
gold. To prevent this, if you cast thin, the alloy of one
℥ d’est of lead for
one lb of tin is good. But if you cast with lead
for a thick thing, one needs for one lb of the
latter, two ℥ of tin, for the
lead, being fatty &amp; weighty, carries more. From this alloy, I
cast a large lizard like a natural one. In thick things,
if which keep their heat a long time, if there is little
tin, it makes it porous. Your mold must not be cold, but
of such a heat that you can handle it without harm, or that you can
keep your finger in the gate without burning yourself.
It is also necessary that your lead or tin be as if red.
Melt first the lead &amp; then the alloy of tin on top.
And as you want to cast, put a piece of rosin &amp; then a
little looking-glass tin. If you put too
much lead into the tin, it does not run very thin. And to know
this, if l the tin cries loudly,
it is a sign there is not too much lead. If it cries weakly, that
means that is there is too much. Take heed



You can solder with the l’es same substance,
then repair it with the burin, file,
chaple &amp; suchlike.




Tin is a metal that penetrates, that becomes porous &amp;
burns, and is fanciful to use, more than gold and
silver.




Lead wants not only to be red, but also lively &amp; runny &amp;
liquid as water, which is a sign of its perfect heat, &amp; the
mold ch is so hot that you can bear putting
your finger in it. Do not open until it is
cooled. It is a sign of a good cast, as much for it as for gold
&amp; silver, when it exits by the vents.
