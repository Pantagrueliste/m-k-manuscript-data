that you can, as long as the joint of the little
finger &amp; of the caliber, &amp; put it in the pipe &amp;
move it up and down until it is completely melted. Next, load the pipe

Another for waters

Daot ni a top with
quicklime, which will consume all this powder afterward, &amp;c.






    Damascus steel

Distil earthworms separately &amp;
horseradish leaf separately, &amp; mix these two
waters, as much of one as of the other, &amp; temper in

For knowing the course one takes on the open sea

Soak a ferlin in oil, then attach it to the
stern of the ship such that it dips in the water,
&amp; it will make a trail that will show for ten leagues
because the water is parted wherever the oil
has passed.





For casting

Chalk most recently taken from the quarry is good
for lead. One ought neither to wet nor grind it, but render it subtle by
pestling or scraping &amp; passing through a sieve. Thus for pumice,
which one ought not to grind with water, nor corrupt its nature. 
Lead should be but little mixed with tin,
only for giving it strength, and two parts
of tin for lead for of one of
tin or more.
