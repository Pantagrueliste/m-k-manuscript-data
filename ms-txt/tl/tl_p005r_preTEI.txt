want to etch promptly, varnish all your work &amp; boil it in the

Steel mirrors

They are called of steel because in times
past they were commonly made of steel polished with
emery putty. But more easily, various kinds are made
with cuivre franc, which is rosette &amp;
tin, because it is cast in a mold &amp; made
round, concave, convex &amp; however one likes, to represent various
forms.

So take half rosette copper &amp; half
soft tin, that is to say fine, which has not yet been used.
Put them in a crucible, &amp; first melt the copper
well. And once it is well melted, put in the tin and mix
together. Then cast in the mold, of white stone with no
eyelets, &amp; anoint the mold with oil, &amp; let
it be moderately warm. Then, having
molded your mirror, you can polish it in this way.

Set one of these in plaster in order that it holds firmly,
&amp; then put the other one over it with thin sand in between,
&amp; rub one against the other, whether it be concave or flat, &amp; thus you
will polish two at once. And if you want to polish them on both sides,
you only need to switch them, that is to say put the one that was
polishing into the plaster &amp; the one that was in the
plaster to polish. After having polished them with the
arene you can soften them with Venice tripoli, 
which should not be sandy, &amp; next with
putty. You polish with
arene using water, but polishing with
tripoli &amp; putty is done
dry. Once polished, you can set it.





Concave mirrors

The concave mirror composed in the aforesaid form produces an
endless number of pretty conceits which seem magic. If someone wants to see
oneself from behind, it is necessary to place the concave
mirror on the ground on its foot, &amp; let it be at a slant;
next, look at it from one pace away. But if you
look at it close up, it will represent you the right way up but
with your face quite large &amp; the hairs of your
beard as thick as

string &amp; will represent a nipple as large as a plate, and
women can see the secret places that they do not
want to show to surgeons. It casts the representation out of
itself, and if you touch le lieu the eye of
the representation with your finger, another finger
will come against yours.

You will make a light at night for someone quite far
away, if you place the concave mirror behind a candle
placed on the window. You will be able to read and write quite
far from the candle if you place it behind the candle
&amp; place &amp; turn the concavity toward you. If you put
the mirror at the end of a table &amp; a
candle on it, it will represent two lights on the
table for you. To see what is happening on a street,
shutter the window, whereby the more of it you can shut the
better it will be. Make a hole at the lower one, as wide as your little
finger, perfectly round, from one side to the other. Then
place a sheet of paper on the window
&amp; let the middle of the sheet be over the hole.
Pierce the sheet in the same place as the hole &amp; the same
size. After, place the concave face of the mirror toward the
hole, &amp; it will represent to you all those who pass by in the
street on the sheet of paper. Similarly with
the pierced door of a closed room. You can make wavy ones
&amp; triangular ones, in the fashion that Ptolemy describes, &amp;
Archimedes. The concave one also sets fire to straw from
quite far away, and lights a candle with the sun. Also, 
it heats through the reverberation of fire.





For bronzing in yellow and white

Take looking-glass tin and melt it. On half a lb of
this, put half an ounce of quicksilver, and remove it
all at once from the fire &amp; grind it, and it will be like
ash. Grind Wash it quite well in clean water.
Next, grind it on marble &amp; temper it with water of
ret hide glue. Next, apply to
your wooden candlesticks &amp; any other work you like,
&amp; burnish with the tooth. You can grind pin filings
&amp; apply them with the said glue.
