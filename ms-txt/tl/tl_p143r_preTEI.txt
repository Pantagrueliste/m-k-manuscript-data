  Molding turtles The water turtle is more beautiful to mold because it has prettier scales &amp; straight legs. And those of the garrigue have crooked ones. They are of long life; getting ready to put them to death, open their mouth &amp; pass a long penknife through all the intestines, &amp; then make it swallow some vinegar mixed with eau-de-vie or urine, as for snakes. One needs to mold them in several pieces, &amp; the back itself, sometimes, because the sides for some are narrower than elsewhere &amp; are not released on this occasion. To make them die, one ought not to boil them, for they come apart, &amp; even the shell, from the hot water. They come out better hollow, because their great thickness corrupts the mold. Those from water are more vigorous. Those of the garrigue are thinner, slower &amp; more sleepy. If you scratch those of the water on their shells, however sleepy they are, they move. Those of the garrigue do not. They die rather quickly in vinegar mixed with a little eau-de-vie or urine, as with all other animals. They keep themselves, in the winter, with their eyes closed &amp; are as dead, being numbed by the cold. They hide in the earth or under wheat chaff or warm manure, &amp; live only on the moisture of the earth.  One ought not to mold them as soon as they are dead because they are still too stiff. But on the follwing day, you will manipulate them &amp; fold their legs as you wish.   Molders from Foix Those who mold crosswise make their sand with crocum &amp; calcined slate, but slate always retains its asperity &amp; becomes porous, because it is fatty. En noyau, it is not good; in sand, it can be accommodated. They sieve their sand, grind it on porphyry, and wet it in water, &amp; they take away the finest, which is on top, then reheat it.   Toad Once molded, it can be removed without burning it, because it releases well. Choose the biggest &amp; the lumpiest. Because they contain a lot of metal, it is best to mold them hollow, for they come out better. You could make your cast in one piece &amp; large, but it s would be awkward to cut. It is best to do it in three or 4 parts, which are a little wide close to the animal, &amp; include as much of the edge of this, which is close to the gate, as can be done. Make also some gate conduits from the end of     Let the mold cool before opening it, especially for thick things.

Thus, the gate being made by wax, you are in no danger of encrusting something from the molded animal. And it is more expedient to make thus the gate of wax, to cast the second mold on top, than to wait to do them after the mold is reheated q, for at that point, it is necessary, if possible, that everything be ready. One needs to heat well &amp; evenly redden the molds where there are gates of wax, in order that it melts well &amp; leaves nothing inside.  Carcanets made Ã  jour They are molded like crayfish en noyau, first on one side, that which is hollow being raised up with clay, &amp; then one uncovers them from the other side &amp; one makes the second casting. They can also be cast well in frames, provided that they are released easily. If they are not, one models them in wax, or else one fills the cavities that cannot release with wax or clay.   Iron filings Because usually filings are mixed with filth, it is good to redden them in the fire to burn the impurities and then wash them in clear water. In this way, the dirt will go to the top of the water, which you throw out, &amp; the good filings will go to the bottom.  Carnations Because the ones that are cast are usually massive, or bi they are weighty, &amp; for this reason, one makes them with leaves &amp; sheets of silver.
