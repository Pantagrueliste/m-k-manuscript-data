  Molding You could mold the thing and animal already cast, but it never comes out as well as the one from nature, with which you can make four or five molds.   Rock &amp; grotto One needs to pestle white &amp; yellow marcasites &amp; diverse kinds of minerals, &amp; then wash them well, in order that the earthy &amp; powdery part is cleaned &amp; there remains only the lustrous grain of the mineral, with which you will sprinkle your rock previously covered with strong glue, if your grasse grotto is r not for a fountain &amp; for touching water, and you will have a nice work.   Snakes When they feel taken, they hardly bite &amp; do not have the power to harm, unless they are really big snakes. The main thing is to keep from being bitten before catching them, and having put your foot on top of it, as close to the neck as one can, one needs to grab it closest to the head, for it cannot bite if it does not have the means to stretch its neck &amp; make a sinuous &amp; oblique turn, &amp; it cannot s harm with a direct attack, since he cannot move forward in a direct line, but writhes in the shape of an S. I saw that the one who taught me to mold them did not take this into account, &amp; assured me that there was no trick to it, other than, when taking it, he would pull it, a little pressed &amp; held tightly by the neck, &amp; passing it under a shoe, he would flatten it in such a way that it would render soubs from its bottom, which is five to six fingers from the end of its tail, all nasty and venomous things that it had in its belly, and that after this, it does not have the strength to bite, and if by chance it should bite or expel through its bottom some filth, he would only dig the earth with a knife, &amp; bury his hand in fresh &amp; damp earth, which, when applied fresh en on the infected part, pulls out all the venom and nothing else. It is the same with toad’s venom, which I have seen experimented.   In three, it is almost as thin as it will be afterward if it does not eat. Molding it very soon after it is caught is best, before it becomes thin. One ought to put it to death only a quarter of an hour before you want to mold.

Molding it very soon after it is caught is best, before it becomes thin. One ought to put it to death only a quarter of an hour before you want to mold.     When it has eaten something, by tormenting it, it renders it up. And if, after having eaten something, it is thus pressed underfoot, this pains it greatly &amp; hurts it. If it is wounded, it will not eat willingly.  Molds There is nothing better for opening them up than to anoint them with olive oil, &amp; nothing else. And next, when you want to unjoin them, soak them in cold water, which is the secret. LAnd you will see that the oil, although it seems to be imbued, will detach itself, like grease. Molds become stronger in cold water. And hot water would dissolve them awkwardly, although once reheated, they are more handleable &amp; easier to dissolve in the water.  Wheat oil Is made on a blade of iron reddened in the fire. And the oil drips off, which is appropriate for anointing the hair of a butterfly or similar thing, for this oil is instantly dry &amp; makes the remainder dry out. It is necessary that the hair or down of any animal that you want to mold be flat, for being upright, it would elevate the sand &amp; become porous. # If you want to mold something delicate, like a pansy, some, to give it a little thickness, more than what is natural, some rub it with butter. But it is best to anoint it with wheat oil, for it has no body, &amp; does not obstruct the small lineaments as much, and makes the flower firm.  Cast of lead and tin Because tin wants to be cast very thinly, if your medal, plant, or other thing for molding is espe thin &amp; fine, do it so that there is more tin, much more than lead, namely less than the fourth part lead for three parts tin. And still, one puts lead only to form an alloy. On the contrary, if you want to mold something strong &amp; thick, put a lot more lead in than tin. And in one &amp; the other you can put a little looking-glass tin, but only a little, with a little rosin, when you want to cast. Since then, when molding with fine and new lead, I put into one lb two ounces of fine tin. And when molding with fine tin, I put in two ounces of fine lead for one pound. I made plants &amp; snakes just like nature. S  I cast tin almost red, and lead the same, which, however, had not remained in the fire for too long, for it becomes brittle and calcines.
