agate of various color. But because this total whiteness did not
respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking,
leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made a opening in
a brick of the exact size of the thing &amp; put it inside. Then
I reddened two glassworkers’
solders, &amp; as they were red, I
presented them one after the other onto the surface of the thing until I
had the white crust that I required, on which I made such drawing as I
wanted, uncovering up to the red base with a diamond
point, and I polished it with small hog bristle brushes
and tripoli. I do not know if it would be better to
reheat it under hot ashes, &amp; if it would be good to encase it
in alabaster, which is very cold, as I encased it in the
brick.







Flesh color from arsenic

Sublimated arsenic, that is to say, the white one that is
sold as stone, when ground on marble, mixed with
vermilion or lake or minium, makes a beautiful
flesh color that is always shiny. Yellow arsenic has a very
beautiful color, the white one is good in oil and agrees well
with the lake.







For dyeing

Mix sal ammoniac &amp; vitriol &amp; boil them
together. Then mix in lake or verdet &amp; azure or
similar, &amp; dye. This will not come off unless the animal
sheds. Non bona.







Polishing of stones

Engraved tai stones are not polished on a
copper wheel, but with brushes and
tripoli. Yet stones cut in facets and flat are
polished on the aforesaid wheel.







Fine sieves of raw silk

One makes tammy of raw silk on a loom, to make
fine &amp; delicate sieves. And for that effect, you must not
choose raw silk whitened by sulfur smoke, which
renders the silk chas charged with a sticky
vapor that would hold the flour &amp; in the end would prevent it
from

For knowing the good cendrée of azure for oil

The one that accumulates in small clods and is lumpy is
the best because it is the most subtle. Also the one that is very
pale in color, because oil darkens it. Certain
sophisticators mix them, but you will know this if you pour
some onto a piece of paper &amp; press it &amp; spread it with
the finger since, if it is mixed, it will be found
variegated &amp; as if striped with a pale one &amp; a darker one, but if it is
unmixed it will be even &amp; of one color.









Whitening of pearls

When they have been applied in embroidery on some garment, they are
greasy &amp; are cleaned in soap water.









Toadstone

The kind which comes from the head of the toad &amp; has
the figure of the toad painted naturally, as you have seen, is
the most excellent. It is held that if one puts the powder of it on a
brazier in the chamber of some persons at night, they
will be neither able to move, nor speak, nor thwart thieves.









Snakes

It is said that if one calls a snake in Greek, saying
ΟΦΗ ΟΦΗ, it will flee. Likewise, if one nom
calls a swine in Greek, y ïon, it
will come.









Candles

Candlemakers never make good candle when the
Autan wind blows because the candle always tends to melt, however
good the tallow they use for it.
