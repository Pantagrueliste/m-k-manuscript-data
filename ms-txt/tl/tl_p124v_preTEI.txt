  Rouge clair enamel Fine gold is opposed to it, for  on it, it remains yellowish. But alloyed gold is more appropriate for it, such as that of √©cu &amp; pistolet. If Gold f is not put back on the fire, with its own pale color, renders the enamel a dead color. Ma And for this occasion, once cut, one puts it back on the fire to give it a reddish color, to make the enamels beautiful. Otherwise, they are matte. There is rouge clair which, once it is used with the arene, loses its beauty. Some can be found that have grains of gold inside, and it is also the opinion of good goldsmiths that the good one is made with gold.   Casting with gold Molds are reheated better &amp; more surely in a closed fire, such as pot in a reverberatory furnace. So that when goldsmiths want to cast some important piece of gold e that has cost a lot to model in wax, they put the molds in a pot &amp; cover them, &amp; fill the pot with earth, sustaining the fire that holds them together &amp; tight. Then, they reheat the mold, earth &amp; pot together, and when everything is quite red, they cast the gold. Fine gold does not run well, but alloyed gold does. Gold &amp; silver do not sour, being entirely red and hot, quenched in water.  Gold is a quarter heavier than lead.  When gold reaches its perfect heat, it is green like an emerald.  Take care that in the place where you want to cast the gold, no lead, tin, or lime of these has fallen in the forge.    A means to make the gate for small female lizards Because you always have to make the gate by the tail, and because it is uso delicate and thin that the gate would struggle metal would run with difficulty, especially when it is curled, roll wax in little threads of this thickness   and apply some with the hot iron wire, as is said, one at the end of the tail &amp; the others, that are applied in the same way, from one edge side of the tail to the other, as you see depicted. But take heed to make sure that with the end of the hot iron wire, the end of the wax barely touches the animal, for the sand of the second cast will not touch this part. But make sure that the end of the wax arranges itself only at the edge of the empty part of the first mold. Make also conduits of wax around the legs &amp; around the contours of the body which are a little long, &amp; they will serve as feeders for the molded thing.  Follow here above üùã   When the tail, which is delicate and closer to the gate, comes out well, the rest will also come out well.  The principal thing is that the ears of the snake come out well-molded.  Your gate must be very thin at the entrance of the animal &amp; of the thickness of a knife.

The principal thing is that the ears of the snake come out well-molded.  Your gate must be very thin at the entrance of the animal &amp; of the thickness of a knife.        üùã From small rolls, you make your gates and vents without danger of crusting &amp; removing anything from the mold, because the wax, being taken away, leaves the empty space all made. Make your vents coming from the head, which is in the bottom, toward the gate. Make also your gate so that it is too but a little thick, and make within its course two or three notches, for this breaks up the fury of the metal and makes it flow with ease, without bubbling nor making excessive fumes, which hinders its run. You can divide it also in two or three branches thus   when it approaches the molded thing, and always make holes in the gate. &amp; from these conduits &amp; feeders, you can also put in small threads of wax which are joined to the body, in order that the metal goes more easily from one part to another &amp; promptly runs everywhere. And from these conduits, you lead your gate &amp; your vents without spoiling anything.   Plaster When you v mold something to cast wax in it, you mold in plaster alone, reheated after being pulverized. For, once reheated in stone, the outside is cooked &amp; the inside stays almost raw. Transparent grey plaster is not strong, but the one that, being tempered, is white &amp; sets very quickly, is good. However, the grey I have found to be quite firm &amp; hard after having set, but its takes longer to do so. One needs to know the nature of each. If you You will never mold very neatly if ne you do not temper, very thin &amp; liquid, your plaster or your sand of noyau. Temper it immediately quickly after it has been reheated.  + If you mold with plaster raw alone, reheat it nevertheless as said. One needs to oil well the first mold. And when the second one has set well, and it is ready, soak it for a long time in water. And if it does not want to release, soak it in hot water, for cold water hardens it.   Scimitars To know The workers from Damascus or from Hungary, neighbors to the Turks, separate, in the ore, iron from steel. And, from this first steel, first melted from its ore, they cast scimitar blades in sand sab which afterward cut the other iron without any difficulty, because any melted iron is harder than soft iron beaten from pigs &amp; bars. Thus is the steel of scimitars, but it is quite brittle. When one un-hilts b a scimitar, one recognizes by the tang that enters the hilt that it is cast in sand.   Hearing from afar Make a small hole in the earth, &amp; place your ear fully there, at night or at a silent time, &amp; you will easily hear the noise.   And hot water softens it further. Cold water does not penetrate it like it does with the mixed one, because it is harder &amp; the mixed one is more spongy. With this plaster, thus reheated as powder, one can cast medals that do not fear the rain, especially if they are varnished. One can find these in Germany, on the houses. But take heed that the water be very hot, &amp; if it is boiling, there is no danger. All plaster molds, alone or mixed, release in it.   Secret
