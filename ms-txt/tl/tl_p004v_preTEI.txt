Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks,
&amp;c

Take linseed oil or more cheaply, walnut
oil, and rid it of grease with garlic &amp;
onions +hog’s
fennel, some also add bread crusts, which you will
boil in it for a good quarter of an hour. Next, put
in one lb of the oil thus boiled the size of a walnut of black
pitch &amp; a double handful of grains of wheat, without
removing the garlic &amp; onions, and let
it boil together for a good quarter of an hour. And
when the pitch is well melted &amp; when the oil has body,
you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your
iron over a low charcoal fire &amp; apply your
varnish with a feather or a brush.
And when you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your
varnish is dry.



For excellent black varnish, add two or three paternoster
beads of jet among the rest.



Some consider walnut oil better.



If there is a lot of varnish, it needs to boil for at least
half a day, for it is better the more it boils. It
is dangerous if it catches fire, if it goes over the top, and is
hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a courtyard or an
open space.

 

In five or six lb of oil, one must put one lb
of galipot, which costs 4 sous, &amp; some
peeled garlic cloves. This varnish in and of
itself is not black, but it blackens over the fire.



See below, around the 3rd part of this book,
after sands, in the chapter on furbishers.





Black varnish without fire, without disassembling the
harnesses or removing the bands from
trunks

Take varnish of spike lavender oil &amp; mix in
soot black or lampblack, &amp; without fire it will mix in
by itself. Varnish with a brush &amp; it will soon be
dry. Turpentine varnish will be quite good, but it does not dry
as soon.





Varnish of iron etchers

Take linseed oil or walnut oil
&amp;, in place of black pitch, you will put in a little
pitch resin, &amp; it needs to be cooked in the fashion of black
varnish on fire. And for applying it, heat your iron &amp;
give it only one layer of varnish, &amp; when it no longer
smokes, it is dry. Next engrave with a steel point
whatever you want. Next take salt &amp;
verdigris &amp; mix as much of one as of the other in quite
strong vinegar &amp; leave it for xx4 hours
before using it, &amp; all will be tempered. Next spread some of this
liquor or sauce on the engraved object with a sponge

Steel mirrors

They are called of steel because in times
past they were commonly made of steel polished with
emery putty. But more easily, various kinds are made
with cuivre franc, which is rosette &amp;
tin, because it is cast in a mold &amp; made
round, concave, convex &amp; however one likes, to represent various
forms.
    
+

So take half rosette copper &amp; half
soft tin, that is to say fine, which has not yet been used.
Put them in a crucible, &amp; first melt the copper
well. And once it is well melted, put in the tin and mix
together. Then cast in the mold, of white stone with no
eyelets, &amp; anoint the mold with oil, &amp; let
it be moderately warm. Then, having
molded your mirror, you can polish it in this way.

Set one of these in plaster in order that it holds firmly,
&amp; then put the other one over it with thin sand in between,
&amp; rub one against the other, whether it be concave or flat, &amp; thus you
will polish two at once. And if you want to polish them on both sides,
you only need to switch them, that is to say put the one that was
polishing into the plaster &amp; the one that was in the
plaster to polish. After having polished them with the
arene you can soften them with Venice tripoli, 
which should not be sandy, &amp; next with
putty. You polish with
arene using water, but polishing with
tripoli &amp; putty is done
dry. Once polished, you can set it.





Concave mirrors

The concave mirror composed in the aforesaid form produces an
endless number of pretty conceits which seem magic. If someone wants to see
oneself from behind, it is necessary to place the concave
mirror on the ground on its foot, &amp; let it be at a slant;
next, look at it from one pace away. But if you
look at it close up, it will represent you the right way up but
with your face quite large &amp; the hairs of your
beard as thick as
