since the two bones are joined,
 cut them evenly all around, & make notches
 around it in different places which cross over the
joining of the two bones, in order to recognize well the
place of the first joining. Or else, with little shards of
wood, pierce them, or  coat the
joinings with some clay, & dry. Press 
your hands joined between your two knees;
& not with a press, because the bones would
burst. Mold also at your leisure & two or three times, until you see
that it is well pressed tightly together & well imprinted. And each
time before replacing the piece, pounce with some
willow charcoal, for it makes it release well. When you
have cast, rub the medal with oil & with willow
charcoal powder & with a brush, to make it dull. Guard
against your medal being too greasy or oily, when you will mold in
cuttlefish bone. When you have cast, leave it
to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it
brings with it some bone. And, cast moderately hot,
something you will know when the bone is about to change
its  whiteness. But when it is too hot, it really turns
the bone red. The proportion of lead
& tin is as much one as the other. If the piece is difficult
to come out, & of several pieces, make the cast forked with three or
four grooves,  & direct these grooves to the
place of thickest parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like
directly on the head, for this attracts the metal & feeds
the figure best. Shake your frame a little when you have cast,
and thus you will make very neatly several casts. Tin that is too
hot burns the bone, which is corrupted. Also, once taken
out hot from the mold, it risks
breaking.
