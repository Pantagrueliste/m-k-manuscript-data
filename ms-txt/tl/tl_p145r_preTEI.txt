Casting in three frames

One casts in three frames bronze mortars
&amp; similar things, which are easily released, namely the body of the
mortar in one, the two frames the
core in the other. And the bottom of the
mortar core in unthe
third one, for small work because otherwise the molding that
is in it would not be released.

Cuttlefish bone

One ought not to cast either tin or lead too hot in it, for
it would burn the bone &amp; come out lumpy. And to
know when it is at a good heat, dip a little piece of twisted
paper into it. If it blackens it without lighting, it is at
a good heat. But if it burns it &amp; catches fire there, it is too
hot. Gold &amp; silver are able to be cast well
there, but it never comes out very neat. To mold something delicate
well, it is necessary that the bone be not so dry
If, for it is brittle &amp; does not release as neatly &amp;
crumbles &amp; flakes. However, before casting in them, dry them, &amp;
especially for gold, which does not want humidity. You will
recognize that they are dry enough when, after having brought the inside
&amp; the imprint of these to the fire, they cry &amp; crackle once
brought near the ear. Then, join them &amp;
lute the joints with a little clay, &amp; make it dry
lightly by the fire, &amp; cast, &amp; then shake the mold or
scratch over rough scales, &amp; let it cool before opening. Usually one
cuts the bone in the middle, and the dullest part and
that which does not have any half circles
    
is the most delicate and smoothest for molding, &amp; thus one always
imprints there the principal; the other is scaly on the inside, as it
demonstrates on the outside. Thus, one does not use this for delicate
things that are molded on two sides. One smooths &amp; flattens these
two halves on some smooth wood, then one scrapes
charcoal on top to make it release well. And to make the
charcoal run evenly everywhere, one knocks on the side of the
hand that holds half of the bone. Once both
charcoaled, one takes the main bone that is
prepared &amp; rounded on the sides, and having set the medal on top,
one tightens and presses it quite strongly.

one tightens and presses it quite strongly.












But because the fingers do not press
evenly, for one if you press on the edges, the middle will
remain hollow. Begin, therefore, by the middle, &amp; then follow the
edges. But to make it better, put on the medal something flat &amp;
smooth, or some large square filee, &amp; press with
this, for you will press equally, sometimes after l
with your knee, other times with your
foot with your shoe taken off, &amp; make the
bone be on top; thus you lâ€™emprand
will imprint it without breaking it. If, on the first go, it is not
molded well, return to it several times. Then, repair &amp; smooth on the
sides your d halves of molded bone.
&amp; And to cut it well, always begin coming from the
softest part to the scales. And if your medal does not come out by
itself, scratch the bone from the back, which is rugged,
and it will release. When you want to cast, secure &amp; join your two
bones with some small points of wood,
&amp;c. But to mold very neatly, there is only our sand.

When you mold them, if they are not strong enough to hold themselves
upright, pass a thread through the mold to keep them
from rising up, &amp; cast the sand little by little, &amp; always blow
strongly in order that it settles everywhere, otherwise it will become
lumpy.
        

Because you did not put in this a clay slab, the
mold sometimes holds to the table where you cast it.
To undo it, hit a great blow of a hammer at the side of the
table.






Molding plants and flowers

One does not need clay slabs, because plants or
flowers are not laid on top but as in air, without touching on any side
anything. &amp; Only the es
circle &amp; contour are needed, which should be
higher than for flat molds. And thus, take heed to make it
strong and thick according to the size that you want, otherwise it would
burst, the sand being inside. Secure it &amp; fortify it well by the
foot, &amp; join well all the joints. Then, take your flower, well joined
&amp; securely adapted to the end of
cir of the gate of wax, which should not be rough
but rather smooth, in order that it can release well. Then, wet your
flower or plant in some good eau-de-vie, or else
moin placed in a long glass










It is enough to reheat your luted mold once for flowers
&amp; to heat it the second time if you cast with tin &amp;
lead, for with gold &amp; silver, one needs to
reheat it twice.


Cast your tin very red in the mold, of
such heat that you can hold your finger
there without harm in the hole.
