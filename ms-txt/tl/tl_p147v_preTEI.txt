I have cast with it the cleanest I have seen, in very small

very red mold, and have put in the melted substance of

which make silver run, &amp; have made as if I had wanted to
cast pure silver. This alloy is white in
bullitoire, like any alloys which resemble, however
little, ☾. For casting something delicate, use
this one.







Lute

There is no better than the one that has which you have
molded, namely pieces from your molds. But one needs to choose
those better reheated.





Crucible

Take heed that it is three fingers from
fe the mouth of the bellows, &amp; that the
said bellows beats from us underneath the
bottom of the crucible, otherwise it would cool it.





Casting of latten

I took the one of latten skillets, which are beaten &amp;
forged thinly. I Once well heated, I cast in it
two or three grains, like peas, of sal
ammoniac. This clarified it like a mirror. Once very white from the
force of being hot, I cast in it some pulverized calamine, raw &amp;
pure. I cast it in its very red mold. It came out very neat
&amp; thin like paper, &amp; hollow on the reverse. But because
it had crusted, I reheated it, that is to say
reddened, let it cool, then put it to the whitening, of one part
raw tartar &amp; of one half common salt. Once
well boiled, I rubbed it with a scratch-brush in clear
water. And because the first time it had not





Do not let it cool when melting. It always makes a tail, like melted
glass, because of the calamine.



Usually, the soft latten of skillets becomes red from casting,
especially when it stays a long time in the fire, m
because the calamine exhales itself. But sour latten of
candlesticks becomes yellow &amp; pin filings.

put it again to the whitening &amp; the

Beautiful color for latten

Having cleaned it well, as is said, &amp; scratch-brushed it
well, make it boil in water &amp; turmeric root
or terra merita, and it will become very
beautiful.







Whitening

If it is for silver, do not pestle your tartar with
iron but with the handle of a hammer, for if you touch
&amp; dip iron in your whitening, the silver would
become red like copper &amp; you would need to reheat it &amp;
put it again in whitening. Mix nothing with your tartar
that should not enter the whitening, for this corrupts it. Do not
let it spill out of its first boil, for in this is all its strength. The
whitening is made with one part pulverized tartar
&amp; a half of common salt.







Molding the foot of the bittern, or of the
eagle, or of other birds for the foot of saltcellars or
vases

One usually molds the foot &amp; the leg up to the joint. And for
this effect, one molds it in five pieces: the leg in two pieces, the top
of the foot in two, and the bottom in one piece.

Crocum ferri

To make this quickly, redden the filings in an
iron case, stirring it often. Then sprinkle it with
good vinegar &amp; let it evaporate, &amp; without removing it
from atop the fire, let it redden &amp; inflame. Once cooled, pulverize
it on marble &amp; return it to the fire,
rou sprinkle with vinegar, and then inflame.
Thus it will quickly be colored &amp; made fine.
