Planting trees  One needs to plant them in dry place dry weather, &amp; gather plenty of earth at the foot all around, like a mound, in order that the rains do not fill the holes &amp; drown the trees.   Casting I have tried four kinds of sand for lead &amp; tin: chalk, pestled glass, tripoli &amp; burnt linen, all 4 excellent. But as for the chalk, it needs to be of the softest kind you can find, like the Champagne one that painters use. It releases very neatly, does not want to be moistened with magistra or anything else, but needs to be completely dry, in its natural state, finely pulverized. The first cast is always the neatest; however, it will well withstand two or three. But there is only the first one that you need to take heed of, when you want to remake your frame mold to take new powdered chalk that has not yet been put to use, for the one previously used in the frame has dried out &amp; does not have as much hold &amp; bond like the fresh one. Pestled glass can be made from common glass sand, however, cristallin is more excellent, for common glass contains glass salt of saltwort only, but cristallin contains both salt of tartar &amp; saltwort all together, which both help fusion, the glass once calcined &amp; reduced as if to its prime substance. In order to calcine it perfectly, throw your pieces of glass, whichever it be, among the largest possible lit charcoals that you can, if you are lacking another amenity tfor violent firet. And when it is well red, throw it into water  Putty is considered excellent for these two metals.

And when it is well red, throw it into water  Putty is considered excellent for these two metals.     and immediately you will be able to crumble it between your fingers and easily pestle in a mortar of metal, or better yet, of iron. Next, it will be easy to grind it, not only on common marble that would corrode, but on porphyry, and it is necessary that it be finely ground with water so that when putting it on your fingernail, you find it soft without any asperity, like the p colors that the painters grind for oil. This one, once dry, you can use au lie instead of sand, in a frame without moistening it with anything nor reheating it, if you do not want to; fumigate the hollow form with sulfur smoke or de p with the tip of the flame of a wax candle that barely makes smoke, and it will make a very neat &amp; shiny &amp; polished work, in pure lead &amp; tin. I would say the same for finely pulverized tripoli that does not want to be not reheated or moistened. Burnt linen gives less trouble than any other, because it needs neither to be reheated nor to be moistened, &amp; molds and releases very neatly &amp; very, subtly &amp; releases well neatly, like the previous ones do as well, &amp; withstands several fusions. First one ought to burn it with a flame, then leave it to rest &amp; to be consumed with its fire until it wears it out, then finely grind it on marble or on a paper. But because a lot And if you reheat it in a crucible, red hot due to the fire, to render all of it fine &amp; impalpable, I believe it will be even better. But because a lot of linen is reduced to very little when burned, if you want to save some, you can sprinkle only the medal that you want to mold &amp; cover it, and fill the frame with pestled slate, which molds also very neatly. But note that the first cast is always the most beautiful &amp; the neatest. If you cast opportunely, soft tin that seems to be burnished in little wheels that pewterers sell, comes out very neatly &amp; approaching the color of silver, without mixing in anything. It is true that one ought to cast it rather hot, &amp; so that the molded object should be 4 fingers away from the cast. In order to know its heat, first melt it well, so hot with such a degree of heat that it promptly burns in a shiver a paper or straw placed inside. Then remove it from the fire &amp; leave it to rest a little &amp; cast. Tin mixed      with half lead comes out almost better than pure tin pure or or lead, even though in any case they come out well. Nevertheless take care not to cast lead at all as hot as tin. In big works it is necessary to moisten the sands with magistra or glair of egg.   Joiner Three things take the longest to make: leaves, hair &amp; garlands.   Sand You should not choose for casting the one that is in any way so lean &amp; arid that it does not have bond, like the one from the sea or desei from sandy paths dried out by the sun. But choose them or in t in the first place from quarreriesries or rock caves, because that one is best, provided that it is very fine. You will recognize the vein of it if, among the greyish rocks or quarries qu that seem to be made of arene, you see, after rainy weather, certain small patches like dust attached to the said rocks, or if due to the humidity, a small piece of it flakes off, which easily crushes between your hands. You will also find in lean soils some which comes off in lop large lumps like stones of tuf et ne, or among terres bolvenes, which are much better than those in fatty &amp; strong earths. And one ought not to take it from the surface, for fear that it be mixed with common earth, but three or 4 feet below &amp; the closest to the tuf or stone. Since it comes out in large lumps one would say that it starts to take shape as a stone. But when it is wet, it comes apart easily. One needs to make sure that when breaking it up it is quite granular, &amp; that when cushed between the fingers, it renders itself into very great subtlety, like impalpable, keeping nevertheless its sandy asperity, without muddying the fingers like clay. It is dried slightly on the  fire, then it is pestled &amp; passed finely through a double sieve or a linen sleeve, then is moistened with wine or magistra &amp;c / Verte  The Toulouse molder reheats it strongly then grinds it finely on marble and passes it through a linen &amp; moistens pass it with wine. He makes the cast very broad &amp; ne flat &amp; barely deep. He casts pure latton used for trebuschets &amp; similar thin things. He casts very hot.  Try calcined vitriol.
