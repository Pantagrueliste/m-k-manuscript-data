  Bubbles and little holes which are found in the mold  This readily comes about when you cast two or three small molds, one after the other, in the same bowl, for the last one is cast from the bottom &amp; thickest of the bowl, which readily becomes porous. The thinnest casts more finely &amp; more neatly, provided that one blows strongly enough when casting on the tempered &amp; cast sand in order to dissipate these small bubbles.  When the sand is cast thickly, it readily becomes porous    Thing that does not release  One needs to cut it to make it burn in the mold, but cut it with chisels in one go, in order that the blood does not fall on the mold &amp; does not create filth, which, once reheated, is difficult to remove. Next, put your mold in the oven or similar heat, in order that it dries promptly &amp; retracts before making a crust or mold on the mold.  + When you mold small female lizards and you want to uncover the part first molded, begin to uncover the heads &amp; you will recognize its place by the pin. Do not attempt to uncover the legs until you have uncovered the rest of the body, in order that the stripped body, as it moves, does not remove the legs from their place, where it is vexing to put them back. When you remove the little points which hold the legs, fix them &amp; press them with something, in order that, when removing the pin, they are not removed from their place, or, in the end, you can put them back with some wax.   Various animals entwined  You can entwine a snake entwine with a lizard, one biting the other, or a snake that eats a frog or a wall lizard s &amp; suchlike.

And it is to      avoid putting points, which should not be put except at the raising of the head, at the thickest places of the body &amp; the simple &amp; delicate parts in the middle of the lizard’s feet, the nails of which you will enter into the clay slab, in order that they remain secure. When you have made the first cast &amp; uncovered the belly of the animal, do not forget to put small thin s slabs of wax at the end of the lizard’s legs. But, if it is a small wall lizard, lightly cover with wax the entire bottom of the foot, and and this the wax, being removed after the second cast, leaves a cavity which fills these small fingers with metal, &amp; then one repairs them. Take heed therefore to attach well with wax the parts of the animal which pass one over the other, in order that the wetted sand entering between two does not take it away. And if For, if this were to happen mold would corrupt, the shape in the first place would spoil corrupt &amp; your mold also, because it would not have the thickness that it you think &amp; would be pierced &amp; spoiled. And, even though to avoid this you can make the mold thicker, however, should l this mishap happen, you will be able to repair it in this way.   For mending a pierced mold  If the molded animal comes away in some place to not have and deviates from the stance that you gave it, because it was not quite dead or because it was not well attached with the iron points or with melted wax, and it does not have the thickness that it needs on the outside, at the middle of the swelling, or is pierced, before removing the animal from inside, uncover what seems to you the weak part, or the place that is pierced, and make small holes all around all around, then soak the back of the mold. And cast promptly on top of the same tempered sand, which will enter in these openings &amp; mold &amp; attach to the other. But, one will need to lute this place well afterward.    Sand of crocum  One can use the mixture of crocum ferri in molds for silver as well as for gold, for it firms them &amp; keeps them from cracking &amp; making flashing. And I believe that for flat things it would withstand bien de several casts, which, however, for gold &amp; silver is hardly practiced.  Try, for lead &amp; tin, crocum.
