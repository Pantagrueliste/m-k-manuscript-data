  Turtles The males have the shell overturned at the end near the tail, and have the shell under the belly notched all its length from the tail to the que head. And the females have neither the overturned shell near the tail nor the notches.   Drying colors Soot black &amp; others would not dry in oil if one did not put verdigris with it.   Painter Colors laid down twice are thicker in and of themselves, if they are not managed. Otherwise, one paints on wood, otherwise on canvas, otherwise on walls.   Gardening For shield grafting, one needs to take the new issue that the tree that you want to graft has made in that year, &amp; there cut a branch on which you see that next to raci the sprouting of leaves there are little buttons that one calls œillets, which are the beginnings of sprouts. One needs to nimbly, with a very sharp penknife, cut in the shape of a shield a little bit of the skin with which contains an œillet or sprout with the leaf, thus marked B. But before Then, carefully make on the tender wood, s which is in sap, on which you want to graft, two lines thus de cut , then make in the middle a cleft thus  . Next, separate, with the point of the penknife, the bark &amp; open it from the cleft in the middle, and having neatly lodged your shield so that nothing comes out but the sprout, bind it well &amp; wrap it entirely with a slip of linen or very soft thread, so that there is nothing uncovered but the leaf, which in three or 4 days will give you an indication whether the shield should take, accordingly it will be green. Leave your graft seven or eight days thus, then unbind it &amp; join it well to the bark, especially at the sprout, &amp; then rebind all gently but not as strongly as before; &amp; if there is any output or growth, leave it space to go out, &amp; do thus three or 4 times.

Next, when it is well b taken, cut the top of the tree that exceeds your tree, ne three or 4 fingers above the shield for the first time, and apr then, at the closest point, in order that it closes. But heed well that when you make your shield no small hole remains at the back of the sprout, for this would signify to you that its root would be broken, &amp; your graft would never take; but make it so that the back is intact. This type of grafting is practiced from mid-May, so that the trees have already budded &amp; made new issue, until the beginning of August, and so that the trees are in sap. Almond trees, which by their nature are drier, lose their sap earlier, therefore those who want to graft onto them mericotons, apricots &amp; grafts of trees with pitted fruit, which are the best there, they are grafted in the month of January. Generally trees with pitted fruit, like mericoton peaches, are grafted in clefts. One says that trees de grafted en piolet or by shield are later in bearing fruit than those by cleft.   Nightingale  It is necessary that the iron wire of its cage be of the thickest, in order that, thinking of leaving, it will not be hurt. Cover, from the moment that it is taken, its cage with canvas. One needs to feed it the first day, giving it taking it out from its cage into the hand &amp; opening its beak, &amp; with a small wooden pin, put it in its throat &amp; make it swallow. And continue thus until it is no longer opinionated. This is done for sustaining it, for if it were to become thin, it would die.   Gardening It would not be very careful to cultivate oraches in one’s garden, because when soup &amp; broth is kept a little bit cold because of it, it engenders worms in it.   Nightingale  It needs to have a cage made like a barn, like those for calendras, doubled with green cloth, because it fears the cold. And for making it accustomed to eating when first it is put in the cage, one needs to give it ants with soil at the bottom of the cage, to make it accustomed to pecking puys luy, and give it chopped sheep’s heart &amp; immediately some eggs &amp; mealworms.   Fountain maker As you will see below in the discussion of the molder, reheated plaster promptly mixed into water &amp; put on the joints of the conduits of fountains s resists as much as any stucco.   Catching nightingales See the 15th folio after this For trapping them, one needs to observe their nature, the food that they like the best, &amp; the season of their pleasure. The nightingale, as long as it sings, maintains a territory for itself alone. Therefore approach, making as if searching the ground for something. And taking some worms which come from old meal or from beneath kneading troughs or mills, which the nightingale is fond of, put some on your hat attached with a pin or otherwise, in order that it wiggles. And at five or six paces from the hedge where it sings, make a hole in the ground &amp; put in some worms and your device of little crossed sticks. It will be anxious for you to leave so it can go see what you have done, and seeing worms, it will enter.      Some sell nightingales on trees. The coolness of the evening and the morning, near fountains &amp; shaded places, are more appropriate for taking them.
