  Blacks Black of charcoal from the mines, of ordinary charcoal, of burnt ivory, of peach pits, of lamp smoke, of burnt bones of the feet of oxen.  Shadows When you are making a painting with several persons, just as the flesh colors have to be different, so do the shadows.  In fresco Azure is not good here, but wan, &amp; one needs to work with long paintbrushes. Fresco is not used cont on wood.  Azure Turpentine oil renders it very beautiful. Test palma christi seed oil. Walnut oil in Flanders costs at least a hundred sous a pint. The azure requires a little fatty oil because it has no body.  Azur d’esmail hates more than any other to be ground, especially with water, for it dies &amp; loses all its color. However, because it cannot be worked if it is coarse, grind not with water but with oil &amp; grind it thickly, and in this way it will not die as much.  Always choose the most delicate one.   Paintbrushes When the color has dried inside, &amp; you want to clean them, soak them in spike lavender oil and they immediately will turn soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in walnut oil. Walnut oil is not as not as appropriate to soften them as that of spike lavender, which is clear like water &amp; penetrates &amp; does not have body like walnut oil. The handle of paintbrushes is made by those who work with care from porcupine quills, by others from wood of arrows from Turkey with whom with which they also make small rods to rest their hand when they are painting.  To work well on a small scale very thin paintbrushes which have a firm point areon needed. And because a squirrel’s tail hair is soft, the most careful take the bristles of the oldest rats, especially of dormice if they can find them, &amp; put two or three of them in the middle of the paintbrush. These make a straight line like a quill &amp; all the other hairs of the paintbrush stick to them as to the point. The bristles of beech martens &amp; weasels &amp; small animals that make musk are even better, for a single hair in a paintbrush suffices.

Lake &amp; lead white &amp; ceruse are easy to work in oil, but every kind of azure is difficult. And to make beautiful azure, one needs to layer it not with large strokes of the paintbrush but with small strokes of the point. Not only ash &amp; azur d’Acre but mainly azur d’esmail which one needs to choose to be very delicate, for it otherwise you will not v be able to work with it except with much work, and even then you need to allay it with turpentine to give it body, and mix it with a little lead white. Any azure wants neither to be ground nor washed for it loses color &amp; becomes pale. But putting it powdered on your palette, you will thin it little by little either with walnut oil or turpentine oil, dipping a knife point in the oil, then tempering it little by little on the said palette.  Shadows The first shadows which are closer to light need to be clear &amp; thoroughly softened &amp; then the last ones very dark to give relief well. The Italians commonly make three shadows, the first one, of light, very clear, the second one darker &amp; the third ones quite strong, then blend these three shadows together by hatching them from the darkest to the clearest.  The varnish is more beautiful on the panel when the color has imbibed well.     Azure Azure is more beautiful when imbibed on the panel without with walnut oil with which it has been first thinned, without putting in spike lavender oil. And if you want to know if it is dry, breathe on it and it will not shine, thus appearing to be well-imbibed. If not, it will shine. Azur d’esmail imbibed in oil tempered in oil, leaves it &amp; returns to its primary nature if you mix it in water. Colors for working in miniature want to be thoroughly ground, &amp; work them with a point of a paintbrush if you want your work to be well-softened.
