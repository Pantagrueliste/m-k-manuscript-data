  Cast of tin If the plant or flower that you want to cast in tin is delicate &amp; fine, it is necessary that the tin exceeds the lead in the mixture, &amp; on the contrary, if it is thick, it is necessary that the lead exceeds. Therefore, for the mixture fine thing, put in some fine tin, not at all the quarter part of lead. And make sure that your mold is hottish, such that you can hold it in your hand when you want to cast. As for the alloyed tin, the same as mentioned, it is necessary that it is very hot &amp; almost red for casting, so that it penetrates. Otherwise, having to run the length of the fine branches of the plant, it will get cold before arriving there. And do not forget to mix in it a little looking-glass tin, which makes it run better &amp; firms it up.  In the lead alloyed with tin, or tin alloyed with lead, you can put a little bit of metalline, &amp; it will seem silver. But do not put too much, for this hardens the substance &amp; sours it also, so that for a delicate thing like legs &amp; similar things, it would not be appropriate.   For giving venting to the mold In addition to your vents, if your es plant is very fine, you can pass a thread through the clay circle, rather than casting with a needle, &amp; make sure it passes through the plant. And with the thread burning like the plant, a hole will remain which will give air &amp; venting, to help clean.   Reheating the noyau molds After your molds have their gate, vents &amp; clamps, as is said, make at the end of the forge en, or in some clean place, a surrounding of bricks, and fill it with large half-lit charcoals. And place your molds on top, and leave the charcoals thus to kindle by themselves for a half hour, so that they heat little by little and not all at once. Finally, as they will begin to become white, beat little by little the thus half-lit large charcoals on top &amp; blow with your little bellows until they are warmed. And thus, little by little, invigorate the fire, without haste, until your molds are quite red on the outside &amp; the inside. If it is for casting some plant or some animal which does not release well, &amp; if, for this reason, one needs to burn it in the mold, &amp; when you look through the gate, &amp; through it, you see the molds are very red &amp; inflamed inside, this will be your signal that they are reheated enough. But if you do not see this signal, increase &amp; continue the fire until it is the case. If there is nothing in the mold that needs burning, it will be enough that they are dried well on the same fire, if it is for casting tin. They reheat better in a reverberatory furnace.   Do not pull out your reheated molds from the fire before they have cooled themselves, &amp; take care that the wind or the cold does not hit them while very hot, for this would make them burst. One must not reheat them before they are dry and firmed up, for they would cast in a different way, and it is necessary beforehand to make gates &amp; vents &amp; place clamps.    Take care not to heat the fire in one go, for fear f that your molds crack inside.  They are reheated enough when the entire hole of the gate is red. When it is black, it is not enough.  For casting in silver, one must not reheat two times &amp;, if there is nothing in the mold that needs despouiller burning, simply because it does not release well. All the molds of flowers are reheated two times, first for

All the molds of flowers are reheated two times, first for          burning the plants, flowers, and animal parts which are left inside. Next, one needs to clean them &amp; remove the ashes. Second, reheat them &amp; render them red for casting. At the beginning, reheat with some charcoals, gently lit, and put your noyau molds flat on the charcoals surrounded by bricks. Frame molds are reheated on a grate.    Molding bouquets, plants, and flowers  One needs to mold them as soon as they are picked because they ont wilt &amp; dry out. Dip them, therefore, immediately in good eau-de-vie &amp; then put them in your tempered sand mold, like snakes. For which one needs no release, for while the molds are being reheateds, the plant burns, which does not happen with animals that have bones &amp; q. It is necessary that for bouquets, the sand be not as thick as for snakes because, if it were thick, it would crush the flower.    Molding de en noyau, with the same sand, wax images or lead medals and suchlike Check if they release well. If they do not, fill with wax what does not, and then anoint your images of wax or of lead with olive oil, very thinly &amp; very lightly, such that the oil makes no thickness nor body on the medal. Then, heat a little eau-de-vie, until &amp; when it is lukewarm, moisten the oiled medal with it, for if it is the water were cold, it would reject the oil, it would not sit well on it. Next, cast your sand of plaster, bri brick, &amp; wet alum on top, having arranged your image on the clay mandore &amp; having made a circle around it de to give it the necessary thickness. These medals are oiled and rubbed thus with eau-de-vie because they are firm &amp; hard &amp; would not be malleable for taking out of thee the mold, which is tenacious, as are natural animals, which are soft &amp; flexible.  When you have tempered your sand, do not cast it in the middle of the mold but on the sides, so that the sand descends gently and that the beginning is thin &amp; afterward thick. If your tempered sand sounds like water falling in the mold, it is a sign that is too thin. Make it, therefore, of medium thickness.    Casting for gold and silver  It is necessary that the molds be fiery red &amp; ablaze when you cast in gold &amp; silver, or you burn flowers and bouquets. The gate should not be very thick at the entryway of the molded thing because the substance flows better when at ease and without shaking the mold, &amp; does not become as porous.   A way to grind enamel gold very delicate gold rose leaves and others  After you have cast or beaten in gold the thin leaves of a rose or other things, if you want to enamel them, you need to solder or braze your delicate gold leaves onto silver strips, which uy will strengthen them to support the enamel. Next, once the thing has been enameled, put the work in aquafortis d, which will eat away the silver &amp; leave all the gold with its enamel. For this, the gold needs to be passed with ciment real.
