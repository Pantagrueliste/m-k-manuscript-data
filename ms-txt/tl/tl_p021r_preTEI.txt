As for small cannons which are not loaded with a ladle,
one charges them with powder up to the escutcheon, which
is placed on the piece with due proportion.

To point a cannon, that is to say to take its aim, one needs to take
the sight, that is to say aim, from the sides before the top, that is to
say above the cannon. For by aiming along the top, you will be better
able to find the line tending to your target, but you would not find out
if the cannon tends more to one side than the other. Therefore take your
sight on one side, then on the other &amp; adjust your piece to the
point at which you aim. Then take your sight from the top of the breech,
which will be done quickly. Next, lower your piece a little at your
discretion if you are within true range, because the force of the
powder usually makes it rise. But if you were farther away than
your piece shoots at point blank, you would need to consider that the
weight of the ball would make it lower.





For firing a cannon at night

Some keep their pieces loaded and from the day. Then, in
order that the gunner can fire into the breach where the
assailed are perhaps making repairs, the besiegers raise a false alarm
in order that the besieged throw torches &amp; artificial
fire into the moats or around the breach, at which the
gunner aims. Sometimes, by using the reflection of
mirrors or flasks full of water, the assailants
light up the breach. The method you know, with a quadrant &amp;
plumb line, is very good. Others nail two or three rows
of boards with strong iron pegs on the wooden platform
made for mounting the cannon, and leave empty notches into which the
wheels of the cannon can just fit. And by such means you will always
te place it at a similar q
point, that it will not incline more to the right than to the left. And
in order that it be neither too high nor too low, when you fire during
the day, you place a ruler fixed well in the ground, which
comes just to touch the the bottom of the edge of the cannon after it
has been pointed &amp; adjusted for firing.

If the
platform, the wheels, or the
wedges break or are disturbed, this
invention is of no profit.

Others place two poles fixed well into
the earth such that one is equally as far from the edge
andof the muzzle of the 
cannon as the other. And underneath they place the above-mentioned
ruler. Then when they want to fire at
night, they push their cannon straight toward the above-mentioned
ruler &amp; make it so that the edge of the mouth rests on the
end of the aforesaid ruler. Next, they measure with a
ruler or similar thing cut to measure, from one pole to the
side of the cannon &amp; if it is too close or too far from it, they
adjust it &amp; do thus from the side of the other pole.





For unspiking a cannon

Some say that one should remove the ball if the cannon is loaded
&amp; give fire through the mouth of the cannon. But it is to be
believed that the fire would sooner exit that way than going to seek its
exit through its usual touch-hole which is
spiked &amp; constrained. The most reliable way is that the
gunner, who is often a founder, wedges &amp;
thoroughly rivets the nail that the enemies placed, and with a
trepan makes at the side another touch-hole next to
the one which has been spiked, which will be done in an hour. And if
with time the violence of the powder loosens the nail with
which the piece is spiked, you will make a thread in the second
touch-hole &amp; place a screw in it quite perfectly which will
never come undone. M





Defense of a town

There is nothing that has a greater effect for the defense of a
breach than petards placed at the entryway at the time of the assault.
They carry a lot of ammunition. be One fills them
with cart nails, large steel dice, bits of chain
&amp; similar things. And when one senses that the enemies are close,
one sets fire to all. Grenades, too, well-made and aptly thrown, cause
great damage. And to make them worse, one puts coarsely
pestling pestled glass either in the molds or in the
crucible, when one wants to cast them; this worsens the wounds.
The grenades ought not to be too brittle. But it is good that they be
somewhat alloyed with the substance of the pieces in order that,
holding the blast a little rather than breaking, they have more
violence.
