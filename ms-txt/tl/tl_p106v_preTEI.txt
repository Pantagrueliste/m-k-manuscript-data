  Casting in gold To cast in gold, il f crocum ferri is necessary, &amp; more feather alum than in the following mixture. The feather alum mixture cannot corrupt anything. The mold needs to be red, &amp; one needs to press it promptly with iron presses. The shell of crabs &amp; crayfish are awkward to burn, &amp; there is a proper fashion of molding them. Rats &amp; birds can be molded, and the feet are awkward to extract when burnt because they are small &amp; delicate. The bodies are extracted more easily from the mold. The feet are cast in many times pieces.   Tiles  Tiles with which one covers houses, the hardest &amp; firmest, and purged of stones &amp; coarse gravel, are used to p mix in with the sand et for molding. But, before, it is necessary to heat them until they have been quite red for one or two hours, &amp; pestle them &amp; pass them finely through a sieve.   The little turtles, having just come out of the egg, are very nice to mold.   Those of the houses that are not sandy seem to withstand fire better.    Plaster  When you have it as a stone, choose the hardest bits and those which do not easily crumble away with your nail, and clean it well from powder &amp; filth before pestling it.   Plaster alone does not withstand fire but breaks up into pieces.   Reheated plaster, se ga, as is said here, keeps well one or two months, well pressed, in a dry place, if it is not rainy weather. But when fresh, it is excellent for exquisite work.   It must withstand the fire &amp; turn red like a lit charcoal.   If the plaster is mixed with some dust or is not the hard kind, it bursts in the fire &amp; causes flashing.   The hardest plaster, as was said, is the best when it is from stone, therefore take it raw of this kind. Pestle it well as finely as possible, and pass it through the finest sieve or sleeve that you can. Being thus p fine, put it, in a good amount, in a cauldron or skillet over an open flame, &amp; as it begins to heat up, stir it continuously, and heavy &amp; coarse as it is, it will become so light &amp; so handleable that it will seem to you not to have any resistance to handlingstirring, as if it were water. Keep stirring it continuously until it returns once again to being heavy &amp; dense, and that is the sign that it is cooked. But do not reheat it until your brick and feather feather alum are reheated &amp; the clay circles are made. For it needs to be the last one reheated &amp; when all the rest is ready, for the less plaster #   Feather alum is the one that gives good binding to sand.   Crocum ferri is appropriate for gold. It is that one which, being mixed among the sand, receives it &amp; holds it within its warmth.    # remains reheated, &amp; more the more quickly it is put to use, the better it is, for it sets more quickly. One ought not to reheat it until you want to mold. And to reheat it, put it, as finely ground raw powder, in a cauldron on ash a clear flame, &amp; do not make it either too strong nor too violent. Always stir with a long stick to avoid the vapor, turning it around the cauldron &amp; in the middle, in a figure 8. At the beginning, you will find it heavy difficult to stir, because it is full of moisture. As it heats up, it will start to throw off some bubbles at the edge of the cauldron. And finally, it will become like liquid &amp;, as it were, mealy &amp; like bran &amp; boiling in the middle. Continue to stir continuously until you recognize that it has once again become heavy, ʘʘ

Continue to stir continuously until you recognize that it has once again become heavy, ʘʘ       ʘʘ as heavy as before, and like a moderately thick paste, &amp; that it is not so easy to handle as when it is liquid. It is a sign that it is cooked enough, which you will know when it also throws off big bubbles or exhalations, in the middle &amp; around, as long as a finger. Seeing it in this state, remove it from the fire, for it is heated enough, because if you were to reheat more, it would be too much &amp; would not set as well. For when it becomes red &amp; overheats, it loses its strength &amp; spoils the sand. Leave it to cool before mixing it with the other sands. And when it is cold, mix and mold, for the sooner after its cooking you use it, the sooner it will set.   Catching lizards and snakes Take a stick and attach a string at the end which has a knot eyelet slip eyelet at the end. And there being two or three to distract the lizard by whistling, approach the eyelet toward its neck, and when its head is inside, pull. The lizard is more tedious to catch by hand than the snake &amp; bites without letting go &amp; grips like pincers. Snakes can be caught by hand, provided that it is covered by a thick woollen cloth, for the teeth of the snake stay in the cloth &amp; cannot pierce like they would with a linen. The dangerous ones are recognized by their blue &amp; asses aseurés azure eyes. They hardly ever bite in water, which crayfish catchers experience. The sand mixture is of two parts of plaster, pulverized &amp; reheated as said, &amp; of one part of tile, reddened et p pre in a good fire after the first cooking &amp; then finely pulverized, and of feather alum, half as much as of the brick, namely two full crucibles of plaster, one of brick &amp; a half of feather alum. There can never be too much feather alum, for s this is what gives bond to the sand, and because it does not burn, it makes sand withstand the fire without cracking &amp; bursting. Otherwise, without it, the sand would not withstand it. This sand, thus composed, is proper for all metals, but if you want to use it for gold, one needs more feather alum &amp; than the aforesaid composition, and mix in some crocum ferri. For it is this one that attracts gold. It is necessary that all sand with which you want to cast well, withstands the fire well, that is to say that it withstands abon c a great firing without getting spoiled. Feather alum is awkward to pestle, and it does not pass through the sieve. Thus, one needs to grind it finely on marble. And the white one que v in powder that apothecaries sell is good. It is ground better su in the mortar by pestling &amp; dragging the pestle, thus you will render it very fine. Crocum ferri must be set ablaze in a glassmaker’s fournaise for four days.
