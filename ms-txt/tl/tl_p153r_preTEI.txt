Molding hollow for seals or other things

First, model your figure in wax on a piece of
glass or smooth slate. Next, mold it with our
aforesaid sand, l’ having first anointed lightly
with oil, as you know, &amp; then rubbed with eau-de-vie,
having and tempering your sand with hot water. Having
the hollow form, cast it in alloyed lead, in the same form as  other figures that you make very neatly. However, if it did not come
out at all neatly, repair it. And then, cast some mold
with some wax on the relief of lead, &amp; you will
have a very neat hollow form in the wax, which comes out very neatly
on the lead. Next, in the hollow form of wax, cast your tempered sand, which will make for you a relief, on which you will cast your
hollow form in silver or another metal for seals. But note
that you should not make your hollow form with melted wax, but rather,
only heated in warm water, or, even better, in warm
urine. Or else, if you have a relief of gold or
silver, or other metal, very faço neat
&amp; repaired, imprint on top your hollow form of wax, &amp; then in
the latter, cast your sand, which will come out in relief, on which you will next cast your hollow form for seals or other works. You could even
cast a hollow form on the principal of metal relief, &amp;
even with lead &amp; tin, which will not melt the
principal if it is lightly anointed with crushed chalk with a paintbrush, or smoked with candle smoke or with
dried glair of egg.

When you have imprinted your seal of
wax, mold en noyau this piece of wax, which is
hollow, like your seal, &amp; your noyau will render it molded,
similar to u the imprint &amp; the seal.



It is necessary that your wax be mixed with some color which
hardly has body in order that you see the imprint better. Lamp
smoke or soot black is good for this. White wax, for
this effect, is exc better.





Giving the thickness that you wish to a medal

Having cast your first mold, mix 
crocum or well-ground iron scales to firm it up.
And having set &amp; rendered your hollow form very neat, take some
paste of fine

Giving the thickness that you wish to a medal

Having cast your first mold, mix 
crocum or well-ground iron scales to firm it up.
And having set &amp; rendered your hollow form very neat, take some
paste of fine


















flour. And to flatten it, take a small stick of
boxwood, very round &amp; of the same thickness
everywhere, which has, at the two ends, a little circle, more raised
than the rest, to give the necessary thickness to the paste. And
then, with this rolling pin, flatten it in such a way that it
is delicate &amp; thin enough. Then apply it on the hollow
of your mold and press on it with some cotton
&amp; your figure will imprint itself in the paste, in relief on
one side &amp; in a hollow form on the other. This done, anoint with a
paintbrush, wetted in a little melted butter, the
part of the paste which is hollow. Then, cut the
excess paste which surpasses the hollow of the
mold H. Anoint your mold also with
olive oil, as you have done with others, place the
clay contour &amp; cast s your
second mold. And you will have your medal as thin &amp; hollow on one
side as you will want. You can have diverse rolling pins, which will
have ends, some more raised than others, to make various thicknesses, or
use sheets of lead &amp; copper of various thicknesses
or of carton, cut with the rolling
pin.

    











If you were to rub your paste with oil, it would drink the
oil &amp; penetrate up to the mold, which it would
attack. But butter remains on the surface of the paste
&amp; is not imbibed at all. You should not, on these reverse sides,
temper your sand with hot water, for it would melt the
butter.

    













Testing the goodness and strength of a sand to be reheated

After it has set, it must be found smooth &amp; easy to cut, and not
rough. It tests better in a large &amp; fantastical mold than
in a small one, for the large one remains long in the fire &amp; the
small one is soon reheated.





Softening gold

Sometimes, there is gold so dry it that neither
cement nor antimony can soften it. But only
verdet can render it soft.
