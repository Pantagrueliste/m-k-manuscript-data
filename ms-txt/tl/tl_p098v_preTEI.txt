  Small dogs Small dogs who should be water-dogs are recognized by this, that they have a larger muzzle than others.   Salted artichokes One puts them whole &amp; not too ripe in a firkin that one fills with brine. Then, one serves them all year among salads, raw with oil &amp; vinegar, for being thus prepared, they take long to cook. But take heed to test your brine with an egg, for if it is good &amp; strong enough, the egg will float on top. If not, it is not strong enough and would not preserve the fruits.   Trees Which bear fruits quickly are aged and scarcely last.   Birds Which have been fed by the rod do not whistle among the company of others if they are not in a separate cage. For teaching them to whistle well, one needs to take them from the nest before they can see &amp; cover them with down or a hare skin. Thus, having not seen their father and known his voice, they better learn the whistle that one teaches them.   Founding The putty is made of burnt earth which has served in the founding; this is earth bourre bolvene, in which one has founded. One grinds it on a big stone, &amp; with this one makes the cope of first coat of the cope of bells, where there are letters &amp; works, &amp; le only needs to be reheated in the flame of straw, and molds very neatly. The earth which molds en noyau is subject to making it porous, if you do not rub well with a brush or your finger the piece to be molded, which should be well oiled. And do it coat by coat, &amp; not all at once.

Latten from a candlestick is not pure, for one mixes in it iron filings &amp; potin. Latten wants to be cast hotter than copper, quod non credo. To cast carefully, one ought not to take metals already alloyed, but take them pure &amp; mix them. Iron hardly agrees with being cast in a mixture of copper or latten. It is better to mold all with one sand, be it in a frame or noyau, rather than in various mixed ones.  One ought to reheat for one or two hours et p, in thata charcoal fire which lights by itself, a crucible with the substance inside, and then blow &amp; cover the crucible with large charcoals &amp; the mouth of the furnace with bricks, and let it consume two or three feedings of charcoal, which se fill the furnace above the crucible. At the end, stoke it to a violent fire, &amp; when the flame is very white &amp; the substance is in a liquid bath like water &amp; casting off pale blue flames, cast. The secret is to cast very hot &amp; in one go. Lean white sand without bond renders quite proper for casting, &amp;, having body, if you grind it very finely on porphyry or calcine it, reddening it several times in the fire, &amp; spread it in vinegar or finely grind it with water, as you know. It also molds very neatly en noyau, as I have experimented. But do not moisten it with salt water if you want to promptly reheat it, for salt boils on the fire &amp; makes pustules, being pressed by the fire. I believe that the noyaulx, gently reheated, would not do this. I molded very neatly en noyau the substance of skillets. White sand smells like sulfur when reheated, and I believe it would melt. And since the substance has been cast in it, it acquires in the mold comme a luster as if it were leaded or vitrified. I believe that glassmakers could use it.  One needs very little sal ammoniac dissolved in water.   Bell handles  They can be put back on without remaking the bell, which one ought to put back in the pit &amp; mold it there. But should you solder a ref cracked bell, it is considered impossible to give it its first voice.
