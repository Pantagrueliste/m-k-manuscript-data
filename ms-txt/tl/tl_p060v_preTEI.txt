Cleaning panels Some clean them with soapy water, others with urine, others with white wine, for dust spoils the colors.  Spike lavender oil  One ought not to put any into colors for it is so brisk and penetrating that it makes the colors flake, which next come off. And for this reason, painters use it to clean their oil paintbrush when they have become hard, for it renders them soft &amp; clean immediately, penetrating the dry color which encrusts them. Also, painters, sometimes envious of the work undertaken by another, in the evening secretly pour a few drops of spike lavender on the oil on the top edge of the panel such that, running down, it makes a stain that penetrates as far as the wood &amp; makes the colors come off such that, to make the work even &amp; of an equal composition, they are forced to do everything again and thus lose their work.  Wood color  One gives a layer of bistre, then a coat of varnish.  Work of the Flemish They do all their works in oil with the tip of the paintbrushes, in f the fashion of good illuminators, and grind their colors very finely, protect against dust, and often clean from their paintbrush the bits of hair which they sometimes leave there, for if these should remain on the work it this, it would prevent neat working, which they are very careful about. In this way their work appears very soft, especially in small work, in which one needs to apply more diligence because one looks at them more closely. They usually finish the forehead, then the eyes, next the nose, finally the mouth and the rest.

But they do not proceed like some others who fo layer two or three different flesh colors, one yellowish &amp; the other darker, because the colors always mix &amp; finally die. They simply  make their imprimatura properly,     and even it well, then and once quite dry, they draw their portrait &amp; layer their natural flesh color, leaving the space for shadow, like the side of the forehead &amp; the cheek, &amp; the area around the eyes blank &amp; dry until they have filled in the rest. Next they put their shadows separately, which they do not make so dark, but rather that which the natural can make. In sum, they do not put shadow on flesh color nor flesh color on shadow, but white on white &amp; black on black Thus &amp; each on their own. In this way their work is neat &amp; the colors do not die.   Flesh colors You need to make two kinds of it, one more red to make the main layer, the other more pale for the highlights, as around the eyes. And then on this last flesh color, you will lightly touch the principal lights with a little lead white. But avoid putting too much of it for this will make it look like a face of death. The beautiful Florence lake makes a beautiful re vivid flesh color approaching  the tint of rose alexandrine &amp; incarnadine.  Certain colors do not want to be ground, like minium and massicot. The ashes do not want to be ground at all.   Rounding If you want to model relief well, arr soften round things by rounding them with the point of the paintbrush &amp; the rest with the flat part if it is flat, &amp; thus for the others according to their nature, &amp; lightly with the point of the dry &amp; flattened paintbrush &amp; with patience.   Lead white Without this, you cannot work on a small scale, for which one needs to soften with great care. But you cannot do it with ceruse because it does not have enough body.   Lights Your paintbrush shows it to you by casting a shadow which must always follow the back of your hand, not in a straight line like this,  for the light would be too crude &amp; too harsh, but obliquely &amp; as if at an incline, thus:  It is necessary that the panel not be facing the light head-on, but half turned against it. And above all look for soft light, for it makes soft both the shadow &amp; the work, as a harsh light a harsh work.
