  Molding stucco promptly Grind &amp; pulverize finely brick or Armenian bole or sanguine &amp; incorporate it with melted wax, &amp; thus melted, cast like the others on a relief medal, &amp; thus you will have a hollow form where you will be able to cast with plaster, pestled paper, or terre chimolée.  Finely sieved brick is better, because the bole is too fatty.   Cleaning yellow pearls Gently boil them in the goldsmiths’ bouteure then, with tripoli &amp; a piece of leather, sprinkled on the flesh side with the powder of the said tripoli, rub &amp; polish the pearl.   For whitening enilanroc Some think that the ceruse-colored crust which is on top is natural, others say that it is a secret of ancient lapidaries that is lost, others say that it is refired enamel. And by means of the said crust, several ciphers, letters, circles st &amp; other bizarre things can be formed. As for the method, I have practiced it thus. Once I wished to give it a layer of arsenic ground on marble. However, I experimented without this, and I put the aforesaid thing, enilanroc, in a small iron casket on the fire of my goldsmith’s forge with three or four small half-burnt charcoals, and blew only with my mouth. And nonetheless the thing came to redden &amp; ignition &amp; turned completely white, not only on its surface but also inside, &amp; then I let it cool on its own near the fire, for otherwise, exposing it suddenly to cold air, it would have burst. Once all white, I passed it through my lead tinwheel, where I found it as hard as before, &amp; uncovering the white a little, I found it a fair flesh color. Finally, I polished it &amp; saw that it took a very beautiful polish &amp; could paragon a very beautiful agate for cutting some beautiful face on it &amp; bringing it on the a table of

But because this total whiteness did not respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking, leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made a opening in a brick of the exact size of the thing &amp; put it inside. Then I reddened two glassworkers’ solders, &amp; as they were red, I presented them one after the other onto the surface of the thing until I had the white crust that I required, on which I made such drawing as I wanted, uncovering up to the red base with a diamond point, and I polished it with small hog bristle brushes and tripoli. I do not know if it would be better to reheat it under hot ashes, &amp; if it would be good to encase it in alabaster, which is very cold, as I encased it in the brick.   Flesh color from arsenic Sublimated arsenic, that is to say, the white one that is sold as stone, when ground on marble, mixed with vermilion or lake or minium, makes a beautiful flesh color that is always shiny. Yellow arsenic has a very beautiful color, the white one is good in oil and agrees well with the lake.   For dyeing Mix sal ammoniac &amp; vitriol &amp; boil them together. Then mix in lake or verdet &amp; azure or similar, &amp; dye. This will not come off unless the animal sheds. Non bona.   Polishing of stones Engraved tai stones are not polished on a copper wheel, but with brushes and tripoli. Yet stones cut in facets and flat are polished on the aforesaid wheel.   Fine sieves of raw silk One makes tammy of raw silk on a loom, to make fine &amp; delicate sieves. And for that effect, you must not choose raw silk whitened by sulfur smoke, which renders the silk chas charged with a sticky vapor that would hold the flour &amp; in the end would prevent it from
