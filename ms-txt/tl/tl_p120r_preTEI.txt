  Stamped medals from wax You can mold in wax, mixed with a bit of rosin so it will be harder &amp; firmer, the relief of whatever you please, either an animal or a medal, &amp; then, from it, make a hollow form of latten or copper. Or, hit it mold it in relief and hammer it in a sheet of tin, Et pu and then fill with lead &amp; heat it. Try sheets of gemstone foils molded in a hollow form for lizards, &amp;c.   Sand for casting in gold Take common sand of alum, of plaster &amp; brick, according to the composition said above. Add to it some more feather alum. And mix in not quite the third part of crocum ferri. However, its quantity cannot be harmful, for it is that which receives the gold &amp; thanks to which it comes out very neatly. But it were good that your crocum had previously been in the glassmaker’s fornaise, three or four days and three days and three nights, in a flat box where it should not be very thick, so that it reheats better.  You could cast gold well in common sand of goldsmiths, should you throw therein some substance that makes it run. Before the invention of crocum, one would cast flowers in silver but not at all in gold. It has not been forty years that one knows this in Germany.  Sublimate is commonly employed by goldsmiths for gold. Some add sulfur, but they &amp; others are wrong, for sulfur sours, even as it heats. And the sublimate is agitated, boils, and bubbles. It is very good to clean gold because by its exhalations, it draws everything out as it goes up in smoke. But to warm gold &amp; conserve its heat, there is only the couleur, which is verdet, sal ammoniac, saltpeter &amp; borax. This makes it run, &amp; you can throw in a branch of wormseed.   IlNightingale One needs for the cage, made like those for larks like a barn &amp; lined with green fabric, to be made with a drawer underneath, to refresh its fresh earth everyday, for it takes much delight in this, &amp; mix in it some ants. You can carry an anthill with its earth in a barrel full of earth, &amp; keep them there &amp; they will lay their eggs there, in order to always have some at hand when you want them, should you take pleasure in feeding nightingales. When you have taken it, it is fat &amp; full, &amp; thus, to keep it in its strength, one needs to, for the first day, take uyit in the hand &amp; open its beak &amp; put in its beak with a small pointed stick some mutton heart or other delicate flesh, chopped up not too finely, in order to fill its belly &amp; keep it from diminishing &amp; growing leaner, until it has gotten over its fancy. The next day you will give him And you will feed it in this way three or four times a day &amp; will also make it drink. The next morning, you will give it in its cage some well-minced flesh with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, and change it two or three times a day, for it will not eat it if it is hardened &amp; if it is not fresh. And if it goes half a day without eating, one needs to feed it as before &amp; do so until it

The best is made of needle filings.  Crocum ferri hardens molds, once reheated, &amp; feather alum, the more there is, it renders them softer &amp; sweeter.   Anatomy  One needs to skin the animal &amp; boil it, or else skin it &amp; put it into good quicklime.   Making silver run If it is for a large work, arsenic &amp; tartar, pulverized &amp; thrown on the melted silver, makes it run If it is and suffices. But for fine work, one needs some aes ustum, filings of latten of thin copper, u antimony, sublimate, finely pulverized. This From this gets made a mass that does not sour. If the s plaster is good, one ought not to add crocum for silver, but one puts more feather alum. It needs also some melted common salt &amp; some saltpeter with the aforesaid drugs: arsenic, tartar, aes ustum, copper filings, antimony &amp;c. See the second leaf following.  Sciscitatio dubia  A little tallow and arsenic     Keeping dry flowers in the same state all year This is a rare secret, &amp; which gives pleasure for adorning tables, rooms &amp; cabinets out of season, when winter denies flowers. Take heed, therefore, to ce pick them when they are in full vigor &amp; growing. For if you were to take them when their season is past or when they are starting to wilt, they would not keep. Having thus chosen them, therefore, take sand, the leanest &amp; driest you can find, which should be very fine, like that which goldsmiths use use to work enamel or like that for stampings. But above all, it must not make dust, nor remain on the hand, or leave a mark on it when you have pulverized it &amp; then poured it from your hand. For it is  River sand washed by the current of the waters is good, being passed through a linen cloth to shake the powder.  + Flowers are also kept in their same beauty in distilled vinegar vin a well sealed vessel which does not allow any wind, which should be well sealed with wax &amp; mastic. Carnations &amp; roses, the residue of common vinegar makes them rot. If the sand makes dust, &amp; clings to the flowers, &amp; is not easily removed with a paintbrush, it is no good. The leanest is the best.  + Make sure your box is well joined, in order that the sand does not trickle out. Keep it uncovered in sunlight and remove it from the serain &amp; the humidity of the night, &amp; cover it &amp; keep it in a dry place.  QueTake heed not to put the said flowers in big vessels, for when one pulls out one, one needs to pull out all.   Take good heed not to pick your flowers w in rainy and humid weather, but when the sun has been shining on them.
