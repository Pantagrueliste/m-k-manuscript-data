Modeling in wax

When wax is too hard, one mixes in turpentine or a
little butter, which  renders the
wax more amiable, and more appropriate than the tallow
that the Italians put in, because one has to, often, put the
tools in the mouth, which are better in boxwood or bone of hart.


Wax for molding -

As the wax is melted, they have sulfur that is
melted, in a spoon or crucible, & they pour some
in the melted wax. And the sulfur going to the bottom or
remaining on top, it leaves & mixes only its substance amongst the
wax, & renders it more meltable when warming it, such that
having molded, it melts in the mold gently like butter, without leaving any pustule or bubble in it. Also be warned to not give it too much strong fire.

with lukewarm water so that it does not repel the
oil.


Bellows of the forge

It is better that, through the blast-pipe, they be fixed in some piece of
thick plank,  for they are more secure for it; next you can lightly
secure them from above. It is necessary that blast-pipes be 4
fingers above the sole of the forge.


Snakes for molding

When you take them for molding, if it is possible, do not remove
their teeth if you want to keep them. For, having had their teeth
removed, they get sore gums & mouth, & can no longer eat. You
can keep them in a barrel full of bran or even better of
earth, in a cool place, or in a glass
bottle. And give them any live frog or other little live animal
for they eat nothing dead. Also I have noticed that
