Modeling in wax

When wax is too hard, one mixes in turpentine or a
little butter, which sont pl renders the
wax more amiable and more appropriate than the tallow
that the Italians put in, because one often has to put the
tools in the mouth, which are better in boxwood or bone of hart.







Wax for molding -

As the wax is melted, they have sulfur that is
melted in a spoon or crucible, &amp; they pour some
in the melted wax. And going to the bottom or
remaining on top, the sulfur leaves &amp; mixes only its substance amongst the
wax &amp; renders it more meltable when warming it, such that
having molded, it melts in the mold gently like butter, without leaving any pustule or bubble in it. Also be advised not to give it too strong a fire.

Molding wax

In order that your mold grips without repelling in any place on
a shape or image of wax, you need to anoint it with oil
and moisten your sand with lukewarm water, for the cold
water would repel the oil more &amp; would not have a good seating on it.





Anoint well, very lightly, with oil, so little that it hardly
appears. Then, rub with some eau-de-vie. Next, moisten your sand
with lukewarm water so that it does not repel the
oil.






Bellows of the forge

It is better that they should be fixed through the blast-pipe in some piece of
thick plank, q for they are more secure for it; next, you can lightly
secure them from above. It is necessary that blast-pipes be 4
fingers above the sole of the forge.






Snakes for molding

When you take them for molding, if it is possible, do not remove
their teeth if you want to keep them. For, having had their teeth
removed, they get sore gums &amp; mouth, &amp; can no longer eat. You
can keep them in a barrel full of bran or even better of
earth, in a cool place, or in a glass
bottle. And give them any live frog or other little live animal,
for they do not eat anything dead. Also, I have noticed that

when they want to bite or eat something, they do not bite with a
direct attack but with sinuous turns &amp; from the side, as do
Satan &amp; his disciples. It has a small head but
a very long body. The entryway to sin seems small &amp; inconsequential,
but the consequences of it are very great. It abstains from eating seven
or eight days, once it has devoured some
frog. It can swallow three or four of them, one after the
other, and what it devoured is neither corrupted nor consumed in one go
in its stomach, but p some part little by little,
that is to say bones and everything. And the remains are found as fresh
as when it had devoured them, such that sometimes, when one presses
&amp; torments it, it renders up what it has engulfed, parts of which
are found totally consumed &amp; others as fresh as if it were alive. It
can keep a frog
engulfed for two to three hours &amp; renders it up completely alive.





Toad

If by chance you want to mold this vile animal, &amp; if it were to
piss in your hand, it would burn your hand
&amp; itch, as if you had handled nettles. But the most
powerful remedy for this is to put your hand into
fresh earth &amp; to cover it as if you wanted to bury it.
A frog is not so beautiful molded because it has lively skin,
&amp; the other has a lumpy one.



You can mold it hollow, and leaving under its belly an open notch, you
will make it jump with the twisted cord of the saw. Or else, if
it is small, put it on a magnet of its size, cut thinly, then
put it in good vinegar.




When it is big, one needs to mold it hollow, &amp; if you want to make
it have an open mouth, put some cotton inside, &amp; then on the
cotton some melted wax.





Killing snakes for molding

Some put a drop of aquafortis in the mouth,
which stuns them well, such that the head &amp; the part behind
seem to be dead but the mouth remains alive, and when you pierce it
with a needle to fit it to the mold, it moves &amp;
spoils &amp; undoes everything. Therefore, to put them to death entirely, put it
in a bottle of good vinegar &amp; some eau-de-vie. And do thus with lizards &amp; other similar
beasts.



If you want to keep them, you can put them in a pipe full of
earth in a garden outdoors. But your pipe
must be covered with archal wire, for otherwise it would
climb &amp; go up very high.
