   When gold color starts to grip, it is a sign that in ten or twelve hours it will be dry &amp; appropriate for gilding.    * To make or mat beautiful, put in a little varnish or fatty oil, not from that which is made from the cleaning of paintbrushes, but the pure, which is made fatty in the sun or mixed with ceruse.  Or mat of this sort is scarcely less beautiful than esburnished gold, and lasts longer in the rain, &amp; besides, &amp; is made sooner. Burnished gold cracks over time &amp; comes off in the rain.   For preventing teats from swelling d or to diminish overly large ones Take large loaves of bread freshly drawn from the oven &amp; split them in half &amp;, as hot as may be done, apply them &amp; they &amp; do this 3 times a day &amp; continue 4 or 5 days. Next, make a plaster with Venice turpentine or better, common turpentine.

Paintbrushes To make them well, cut the hair from the tail of a squirrel’s fur, as much in one go as one can hold in a card folded up like a cannule.

When it pleases you, bind b and tighten it very well with a thread in two places, then cut the excess &amp; fit it in a quill of a convenient thickness for it, of a duck or a crow for the small ones. Good paintbrushes are those that, once dipped in water, do not bulge when you trace on your hand.   Oil All oil which is imbibed by paper &amp; once heated by fire evaporates &amp; leaves the paper clean, like turpentine &amp; spike lavender oil, is good for making varnish.   Sand Every ground &amp; tempered thing becomes porous, according to some.   Bellows furnace Before putting in the metal, it is necessary that it be red at the bottom, like a charcoal &amp; well inflamed. Next, you  fill it &amp; cover the charcoal &amp; adjust the bellows, otherwise the metal on top would melt by means of the bellows &amp; its bottom would be curdled &amp; cooled &amp; would not run. But if you proceed in this manner you will melt everything you like.   Varnish on paper The Germans make boxes p covered with painted paper &amp; varnish it with glair of egg mixed with gum &amp; a little oil, not of spike lavender, but another fragrant one that resembles olive oil. Every work done with glair supports oil. It is with this that painters trick the poor peasants, painting their bands of taffeta with this glair, to be done sooner. But the first rain carries away everything.
