Molding en noyau. Mixture of sand

Having reheated your sand, namely the plaster, the
feather alum &amp; the brick, &amp; having
passed them finely through the sieve,
#, mix them this way: take four parts of
plaster, two of brick, &amp; one of feather alum. Mix them all together with your hands
that it in such a way that one cannot discern one from
the other. With your sand ready, you need to put to death the animal that you
want to mold de, in this manner.

should be ground in a mortar





Putting to death the animal for molding

You need to be careful not to wound it in taking it. And, having put
it in a glass bottle d with
bran, or in a barrel full half full of
fresh &amp; damp earth, if you want to store them or keep them a
long time, give them live frogs &amp; not dead ones
to eat. For if you keep them without feeding them, they wither &amp;
grow thin &amp; have long wrinklaulxed skins. Thus the best would be to
mold it as soon as after possible
apre after it has been taken. But before, put it to
death in this way. Place it in a clean bottle or vessel so
that it would collect no dust. And put inside such a quantity of good
vinegar &amp; urine that it can be covered. And shake it
&amp; torment it therein until it is dead, which will be in an hour or a half. But if you are in a
hurry



To know if it is quite dead, take it out of the vinegar and take
it by the tail. If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling,
&amp; when piercing it, it would draw back &amp; spoil the mold.

to cast, make him take through the mouth some good eau-de-vie or else mix a little with the vinegar. And soon it will
be dead, without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for
whom one would need a lot of eau-de-vie, one uses
vinegar and er urine. But for small
ones, only eau-de-vie, which is done sooner.
When your animal is dead, take it out &amp; clean it carefully of its
old skin, if it sheds, or of the filth, or of the lice, like
lizards have, and then arrange it thus.





Now, put enough in a glass, &amp; soak &amp; continually keep in it
the head of the animal, or the whole of it, if it is not
big.





Take heed, before it dies, to keep the eyes open es
by blocking the eyelids with a little bit of wax or something
else.







For molding Making the arrangement and disposition
of the animal

Having made provision of fatty earth called
clay, that should be grey because that commonly is the best, or
another which has good binding &amp; which should be well prepared &amp;
beaten, such that it is handleable without attaching to the
hands nor the work, make a lasagna or like a

cake of this earth equally flattened with a round

stick which pastry makers use, which should be a little
thicker than a thumb. And on this
cake, arrange your animal, aya
imitating in that its nature &amp; fa the fashion in
which it commonly turns itself. And first, with a good needle,
pierce it from underneath in the middle of the throat &amp; up to
u the top bone of the head. Retract the
needle, &amp; in its place &amp; its hole, put the point of
an iron wire of such a length that it suffices to hold the
head of the animal as q high as it must be, &amp; if
the skin moves into the inside &amp; when you put in the
    point
, pull it out with a
point the edge of your small pincers, &amp;
arrange it as it was. Push the other end of the point in the
cake of clay. Thus, the head will be held high,
which will have better grace, &amp; being secured, next, arrange the gesture
of the body &amp; the feet &amp; the entanglement as you think will
look best. And so that it is secure &amp; does not move at all when you
cast in the sand, put secure the legs
&amp; the corp with little points of iron
wire, having already made the first hole with a very sharp
needle. Do the same on the body parts that you will deem necessary,
arranging making sure that the points
passing through the animal are fixed in the cake of earth
and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal
by a





Take a fine needle of steel, &amp; which is the sharpest
possible, in order that, making with it the first hole to place the points
of iron, it passes without forcing anything, &amp; by its
roughness does not push in or pull out the skin. Next, put in a thickish
point of iron in thick places &amp; thin ones in thin
places. But heed as a secret to not plant, in the first go, the
point passed through the animal in the slab of earth,
for but having planted it, take it out of the
earth &amp; not out of the animal, &amp; do ains 
next, fix it. This is done because, by fixing it the
first time, it pushes in the skin of the snake, and by taking
the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.






When you put again the points you have already used, clean them
well of rust so that they do not take away some skin.





The main layout of your arrangement is to di place
the head raised &amp; looking sideways. For this effect, pierce the head
on a solid plank or table &amp; , making the
point pass through the bottom of the throat,
s’arrestan entering into the top of the head
