         <ab>One needs to first make the branches of <m>wood</m> or take a
bizarre <m>thorn branch</m>, then melt a <ms>lb</ms> of the most

<m>subtly ground vermilion</m> with <m>
               <pa>walnut</pa> oil</m>, and if
you add in a little <m>
               <pl>Venice</pl> lake <fr>platte</fr>
            </m>, the
color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the <m>resin</m> melted
over a <m>charcoal</m> fire and not of flame, for fear that the fire
catches within. Next dip in your branches while turning, &amp; if there
should remain any filaments, turn the branch over the heat of the
<m>charcoal</m>.</ab>

            <m>Colophony</m> is nothing other than <m>resin</m> cooked again. To do
it well, take a <tl>
               <m>leaded</m> pot</tl> &amp; melt the <m>resin</m>,
&amp; boil it over the <tl>brazier</tl> a good <ms>
               <tmp>hour</tmp>
            </ms>,
&amp; until it appears not to be thick, but clear &amp; liquid like
<m>water</m> &amp; it easily runs &amp; flows from the tip of a
<tl>stick</tl> with which you grind it, &amp; try it. Then pour it
through a <tl>
               <m>coarse canvas</m>
            </tl> or a <tl>
               <m>very light tammy
cloth</m>
            </tl>, in the manner that when pouring it falls into the
strongest <m>vinegar</m> that you can find, for the <m>vinegar</m> gives
it strength &amp; prevents it from being so fragile. Reiterate this two
or three times &amp; it will be beautiful &amp; well purified. For
imitating your <m>coral</m>, you can mix a <ms>quarter part</ms> of
<m>mastic</m> within your <m>purified resin</m> to render it more firm
and more beautiful, &amp; if you should take only a tear of
<m>mastic</m>, it would be all the better, but it would be too long.

it in a <tl>pot</tl> until it simmers, and put in half a <ms>lb</ms> of

<del>
               <fr>elle</fr>
            </del> it is done. But if it seems too thick to you,
add in a little more <m>oil</m>. Similarly if it is too clear, you can
thicken it by putting a little <m>turpentine</m>. Thus you will give it
whatever body you want. It could be made well without fire, but, when
heated, it is more desiccative. It is appropriate for panel paintings
and other painted things without distorting the colors or yellowing. And
it dries both <env>in the shade</env> and <env>in the sun</env>, and
<tmp>overnight</tmp>, and <tmp>during the winter</tmp> as well as
<tmp>in the summer</tmp>. It is usually sold 15 <cn>sols</cn> a

<tl>
               <bp>finger</bp>
            </tl> in order to spread it thinner and less thick,
for when it is thick, it turns yellow and sticks. One does not
<m>varnish</m> to make paintings shine, for it just takes the light out
of them.</ab>

         <ab>

over a <m>charcoal</m> fire stir continuously until the <m>sandarac</m>

<m>pulverized sandarac</m>, although some only put in four
<ms>ounces</ms>, but this is not so good nor so fatty. This one is
promptly dry. <pro>Framemakers</pro>, to avoid the trouble of polishing
their <m>ebony</m>, varnish it with this, as do <pro>guitarmakers</pro>.
This is not as appropriate for panels as that of <m>fine turpentine</m>,
though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not used to
varnish the landscape of a panel when <m>linseed varnish</m> was in use,
because it would have yellowed the landscape. But with that of
<m>turpentine</m>, one varnishes everything. You can put in
<m>pulverized mastic</m> extracted in tears or otherwise, and it will be
more dessicative in place of <m>sandarac</m>.</ab>

         <ab>If you want to varnish on <m>plaster</m> or a wall, first put on
your very hot <m>

         <ab>
            <figure>+</figure>They are called of <m>steel</m> because in the
past they were commonly made of <m>steel</m> polished with <m>potée of
emery</m>. But more easily, various kinds are made of <m>cuivre
franc</m>, which is <m>rosette</m>, and <m>tin</m>, because this can be
cast in a mold &amp; made round, concave, convex &amp; however you like,
to produce various forms.</ab>

         <ab>So take half of <m>rosette copper</m> &amp; half of soft <m>tin</m>,
that is to say fine, which has not yet been used. Put them in a
crucible, &amp; first melt the <m>copper</m> well. And once it is well
melted, put in the <m>tin</m> and mix together. Then cast in the mold,
of <m>white stone</m> with no eyelets, &amp; grease the mold with
<m>oil</m>, &amp; let the mold be moderately warm. Then, having molded
your mirror, you can polish it in this manner.</ab>

         <ab>Set one of these in <m>plaster</m> in order that it holds firmly,
&amp; then put the other one over it with thin sand in between, &amp;
rub one against the other, whether hollow or flat, &amp; thus you will
polish two at once. And if you want to polish them on both sides, you
only need to switch them, which means putting the one that was polishing
into the <m>plaster</m> &amp; using the one that was in the
<m>plaster</m> to polish. After having polished them with the
<m>
               <fr>arene</fr>
            </m> you can soften them with <m>tripoli of Venice</m>,
which should not be sandy, &amp; after with <m>potée</m>. You polish
with <m>arene</m> using <m>water</m>, but polishing with <m>tripoli</m>
&amp; <m>potée</m> is done dry. Once polished, you can set it.</ab>

oneself from behind, it is necessary to place the concave mirror on the

step away. But if you look at it closer up, it will show you the right
way up but with your face quite large &amp; the hairs of your beard as

another <bp>finger</bp> will come against yours.</ab>

         <ab>You will be able to make a light at night for someone quite far
away, if you place the concave mirror behind a candle placed on the
window sill. You can read and write quite far from the candle if you
place it behind the candle &amp; place &amp; turn the concavity towards
you. If you put the mirror at the end of a table &amp; a candle on it,
it will represent two lights on the table for you. To see what is
happening on a street, shutter the window, or the more you can shut the
better, make a hole in the bottom <sup>pane</sup>, the size of your
<ms>
               <bp>little finger</bp>
            </ms>, perfectly round all the way through.
Then apply a sheet of paper onto the window and let the middle of the
sheet be over the hole. Pierce the sheet in the same place as the hole
and of the same size. Then turn the concave face of the mirror towards
the hole, and anyone passing by in the street will be reflected on the
sheet of paper. Do the same with the pierced door of a closed room. You
can make wavy <sup>mirrors</sup> and triangular ones, such as are
described by Ptolemy and Archimedes. The concave sort can also set fire
to straw or light a candle from afar, using the sun. By reverberating
fire too, it can provide warmth.</ab>

            <m>Ceruse</m> &amp; <m>lead white</m> is not appropriate for polished
white nor for burnishing because it is fatty, but it is quite good for

Therefore for <m>burnished gold</m> take <m>good chalk, quite white,
well ground</m>, &amp; soaked with <m>distemper glue</m>, &amp; make
four layers of it, one after the other, on the <m>wood</m>. And once the

plant otherwise called <m>
               <pa>horsetail</pa>

else. You can bend them with a <m>wood</m>en model over a brazier or by
the heat of a <tl>lamp</tl>. A cane can be stretched out as long as you
want in a small <tl>furnace</tl> made like a <tl>reverberatory oven</tl>
but with openings on both sides. And once the large cane is red, they
seize the hot end of it with <tl>small pincers</tl> that have long
beaks, with one end of the beak inside the end of the cane, so that it
may be stretched without becoming blocked. The other end of the cane is
held with the hand, as it is not hot. Once the cane is stretched enough,
the one who is working seated with his <tl>stove</tl>, the size of a
carnation pot, placed in front of him, breaks it off and carries on.
This is for making canes for capes, which may be cut, as already

of<m>glue</m> here as on <m>wood</m>, but take only <m>fatty oil</m>,
which is made in seven or eight <ms>days</ms>

<m>walnut oil</m> and <m>lead white</m> 
            <del>&amp; with</del>, stirring

at discretion, as much of one as of the other. <m>Minium</m> gives color
to the <m>gold</m>. Next, with this, you make a layer of it evenly on
your stamp, taking care not to fill the hollows. And once it is almost
dry, lay the <m>gold</m> leaf on it with <m>cotton</m>. Such <m>gold</m>
will hold up <env>in the rain</env> on houses &amp; elsewhere. And if

apply the gilded stamped ornament on them with <m>strong glue</m>.</ab>

After you have laid down all the colors, scrape oblique lines on them,
then lay down <m>gold &amp;silver leaf</m>. If you lay down on the

         <head>Painting <m>esmail d’azur</m> in <m>oil</m>
         </head>

         <ab>This is a secret that is hardly known to <pro>common painters</pro>.
Some take the most delicate they can &amp; grind it with <m>ceruse</m>,
which binds it, and next prick with an <tl>awl</tl> in several places
the area they want to paint with <m>azur d’esmail</m>, such that the
<m>oil</m> enters &amp; leaks in, &amp; <add>
               <fr>ne</fr>
            </add> does not
cause the <m>azure</m>, which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the
panel flat &amp; put down the <m>azure</m> on it, which is also done
<fr>à destrempe</fr>. The main thing is to grind it well on
<tl>
               <m>marble</m>
            </tl>, and before that, to have washed it thoroughly.
Some grind it <del>with</del> thoroughly with an <m>egg yolk</m> &amp;
then wash it in five or six <tl>
               <tl>
                  <m>waters</m>
               </tl>
            </tl> and lay it
on not with a <tl>
               <fr>painceau</fr>
            </tl>, which would be too soft, but
with a <tl>
               <fr>broisse</fr>
            </tl> thoroughly softened &amp; crimped,
&amp; laying it on thickly as if one were putting it down with a
<tl>trowel</tl>; settling down it evens out and flattens. I have
experienced that grinding <m>
               <fr>azur d’esmail</fr>
            </m> with <m>egg
yolk</m> &amp; next washing it in several <tl>
               <m>waters</m>
            </tl> is
good. However, it loses a little of its vividness in the grinding of it.
I have also washed it in several <tl>
               <m>waters</m>
            </tl> &amp;, when it
had settled a little, I removed the <tl>
               <m>water</m>
            </tl>, still
<del>q</del> blue, with a <tl>sponge</tl> and squeezed it into another
<tl>vessel</tl> 
            <del>thus</del> 
            <add>where it settled, &amp; from the
residue</add> I had the ash, flower and subtlest part of the
<m>azure</m> without grinding it, which is the best, for in the grinding
of it, it loses some of its tint. Those who make it in <pl>Germany</pl>
compound it like <m>enamel</m>, in large pieces which they pestle, &amp;
pass through several <tl>sieves</tl> &amp; wash.</ab>

         <ab>To make <m>azures</m> beautiful, they wash or soak them in a
<tl>
               <m>
                  <df>rock water</df>
               </m>
            </tl>, as they call it; it is a
<m>water</m> distilled from mines where <m>azure</m> or <m>
               <fr>vert
d'azur</fr>
            </m> is found, which distills naturally through the
<env>veins of the mountain</env> or is distilled through an
<tl>alembic</tl> 
            <del>
               <fr>par</fr>
            </del> from mineral stones of
<m>azure</m> or <m>copper</m>.</ab>

         <ab>
            <m>
               <add>Azure</add> ash</m> are only good for landscapes because
they die in <m>oil</m>. Only true <m>azure</m> holds on. <m>Azur
d’esmail</m> cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it, therefore, on
the <tl>
               <bp>fingernail</bp>
            </tl> or the <tl>
               <m>oil</m> palette</tl>. If
it <del>
               <ill/>
            </del> happens to be sandy, do not grind it except with
the <m>egg yolk</m> or, better yet, wash it in <tl>
               <m>clear
water</m>
            </tl> &amp; with a <tl>sponge</tl> remove the <tl>
               <m>colored
water</m>
            </tl> after it starts to go to the bottom, and in this manner
you will extract the very delicate flower, which will be easy to work
with.</ab>

            <m>agate</m> of various color. But because this total whiteness did not
respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking,
leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made a opening in
a <m>brick</m> of the exact size of the thing &amp; put it inside. Then
I reddened two <tl>

were red, I presented them one after the other onto the surface of the

         <head>For <m>earth</m> walls and rustic construction</head>

         <ab>
            <al>Swallows</al> have taught us this craft by building their nests
out of <m>mud</m> mingled with <m>wisps</m> and bits of <m>hay</m> or
<m>straw</m> to make it bond. Therefore, in places where <m>stones</m>
and <m>bricks</m> are lacking, one can use <m>earth</m> to make walls
thin and thick. The best for this is light <m>earth</m>, which does not
form clumps when plowed, or better, that which in some way mingled with
<m>arene</m>, because it can be most easily beaten and tamped down. It
is true that it needs to be dampened and cut into clumps with a
<tl>ditch-spade</tl>, and put and placed in this form. This one lasts
more and does not require that much effort, and dryness doesn't make it
split or crack. However, since such kinds of earth are not found
everywhere, those who live on good and fertile land, after drawing the
width and length of their foundations with a <tl>rope</tl>, drive in
long <tl>poles</tl> and <tl>rafters</tl> along the edges on each side to
support boards between which they throw the <m>earth</m>, making each
layer about one foot thick, interspersed with
<figure>S.S.S</figure>-shaped branches of <m>
               <pa>heather</pa>
            </m> or
similar things, then they tamp it down and beat it with beaters of three
different forms. One is called the mall, which has a triangular form
like A, and this is used firstly to tamp down the <m>earth</m>. Then one
uses another made of pointed <tl>woodblocks</tl> fitted onto a thick
<tl>stick</tl>, and this one is used to properly press the <m>earth</m>
at the wall’s ends and edges where they adhere to the boards, and is
called <gap/>. The other one is called the bat and is used to flatten
and beat the <m>earth</m> for the last time, as shown in C. Then one
makes another layer of <m>earth</m> and <m>
               <pa>heather</pa>
            </m> and
beats as has been said, and continues thus until completing the wall,
which is covered with <m>
               <pa>heather</pa>
            </m> and then with
<m>earth</m>. Some intersperse the said wall with rows of <m>bricks</m>.
They also make walls with a sloped foot, adding width to the foundations
according to how high they want to build the wall. When it is old it
whitens, showing that it has <m>saltpeter</m> in it. Which is why, when
they fall down, <pro>gunpowder makers</pro> profit from them.</ab>

         <ab>You can damask a <m>cloth</m> with two different colors and imitate
embroidery without adding anything else to it, in this way. Once it is
<m>dyed</m> yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you.
Then you will baste some <m>string</m> or a thicker <m>cord</m> onto the
pattern and throw it into a <m>dye</m> of <m>
               <pa>guesde woad</pa>

<m>
               <pa>pastel woad</pa>
            </m> &amp; it will become green, except that
which is beneath the <m>string</m>, which will remain yellow because the
<m>green dye</m> will not have penetrated there. And you can do thus
with other colors, and instead of <m>cord</m> or <m>string</m>, add some
pieces of <m>paltry cloth</m>, cut into moresque shapes, on top of the
first color. In that manner, you will have cheap embroidery.</ab>

            <figure>+</figure>, dries out &amp; loses its ability to bond. However,
it is used to mix with the new sand, for it makes the work not so
porous. One casts large works such as artillery, bells &amp; similar
things in <m>earth</m>, &amp; <m>copper</m> cast in <m>earth</m> makes
less of a <fr>chappe</fr>, and is whiter than the one cast in sand. The

         <ab>Most people consider that <m>iron</m>, once melted, cannot be melted
again because they only heat it in small <tl>forge</tl>s, in which it
only becomes red-hot. <pro>Alchemists</pro> undertake to melt it with
<m>realgar</m> or <m>lead</m> or mixed <m>orpiment</m>. But without all
that, some have found a way to <del>the</del> melt not only brittle
<m>iron</m>, such as <del>
               <fr>d</fr>
            </del> the kind used for <m>iron</m>
pots, but also soft <m>iron</m> such as that of pigs &amp; ingots, which
is the most difficult kind. And to this effect they make a
<tl>furnace</tl> in this manner which has a width of one
<ms>
               <fr>pan</fr>
            </ms> &amp; a half &amp; <del>one <ms>

&amp; a half of</del> a depth of two <ms>
               <fr>pan</fr>
            </ms>s. And the
<fr>tuelle</fr>, which is the barrel <del>through</del> marked A through
which the <tl>bellows' pipes</tl> enter, has to be placed in the middle
of the depth of the furnace such that there is one <ms>
               <fr>pan</fr>

The <pro>miners</pro>, to make the <m>iron</m> run, put at the mouth of
the <tl>forge</tl>, two or three handfuls of <m>
               <pa>wallwort</pa>
            </m>
whenthey want to make the <fr>fonte</fr> run, and this renders the
<m>iron</m> wonderfully ductile and flowy.</ab>

         <ab>It is also necessary that the <fr>tuelle</fr> enters through to the
middle of the mouth of the<tl>furnace</tl>, which is a principal part of
the secret because the wind will hit the edge &amp; the wall which makes
up the belly of the <tl>furnace</tl> &amp; by such means, it spreads
equally everywhere &amp; above, like the flame in a reverberatory
furnace, &amp; by such means heats much more; for if the wind were to
hit directly from above, the substance which is melted or ready to be
melted, it would cool it down &amp; prevent it from running &amp;
melting. It is also necessary for the <tl>bellows</tl> to be driven by
the falling &amp; running of <m>water</m> as in <tl>forges</tl>, because
in this manner, the <tl>bellows</tl> run with measure &amp; compass
&amp; with great speed, which the strength of <pro>workers</pro> could
<del>d</del> not do. Therefore one raises the wall as you see &amp; the
furnace on the surface of the ground at the edge of which you make a
channel as with other <fr>fontes</fr>, to put the molds of that which
you want to cast &amp; to do this, you unstop the opening that you had
made at the bottom of the <tl>furnace</tl> to make the melted substance
run. You will be able to melt two <ms>quintals</ms> of <m>iron</m> each
time and to do this, you will choose the biggest <m>charcoal</m> you can
find &amp; put a load of it at the bottom, on the plane and surface of
the furnace &amp; with the bottom piling up <del>as if</del> to a point,
up to the top of the wall

         </head>

         <ab>

A cannon has a range of five to six hundred <ms>paces</ms>, but for a
battery, the range is a maximum of two or three hundred <ms>paces</ms>
to be effective. It should not be any farther. Its cannonball usually
weighs 40 <ms>lb</ms> of the King's standard. The fowler weighs 25
<ms>quintals</ms> and is a small, short cannon for fighting the
casemates of moats and at close range. It shoots large cannonballs that
weigh, like the others, 40 <ms>lb</ms> of the King's standard. The
breech is two balls and a quarter thick; the mouth is one ball and a
third thick. Its load is similar to the biggest ones, that is to say 20
<ms>pounds</ms>. And if you want to try it, don't overload it, for it
would damage it. And the first time and the first five or six shots, it
is better not to load it completely, it adjusts itself. What one can do
in such a case, is to load 20 <ms>pounds</ms> of fine arquebus
<m>powder</m> instead of ordinary cannon <m>powder</m>. And four good
<al>horses</al> are enough to carry it. They are easy to use and on a
small distance they are as strong as the big ones even for private
houses and small <fr>billattes</fr> and less important fortresses. They
are less prone to breaking than other <sup>cannons</sup> because they
are short. What gives strength to the <m>powder</m> and increases the
danger of breaking is the length of the cannon, because the
<m>powder</m> burns entirely and its force is held longer within the
longer cannon than the short one. The fowler is usually seven to eight
<fr>
               <ms>pans</ms>
            </fr> long. It is true that this measure is a
<ms>
               <pl>Montpellier</pl> 
               <fr>pan</fr>
            </ms> and not a <ms>King's
pan</ms>, the latter is not used for good cannon founding. Since the
<ms>
               <pl>Montpellier</pl> 
               <fr>pan</fr>
            </ms> is shorter, cannons made
using this measure are shorter, but compensate in thickness the ones
made using the <ms>King's <fr>pan</fr>
            </ms>, which are longer, but more
fragile. The Fowler's strength for battery is 80
<fr>
               <ms>pans</ms>
            </fr>.</ab>

         <ab>

            <margin>left-top</margin>

The great cannon, because of its cannonball's weight, ranges not further
than a thousand or twelve hundred <ms>paces</ms> without landing, and
usually makes 3 jumps.</ab>

Fowlers have only a short range efficiency.</ab>

You recognize a cannon's good alloy when you see it. If there is green
color on the surface becomes red, it means they are made of a sufficient
quantity of <m>rosette</m>. Otherwise, the cannon's <m>metal</m> will
appear whitish. If you don't see it, just scratch it and you will see
it. </ab>

         <ab>

            <margin>left-bottom</margin>

The good alloy for the cannon is three <fr>
               <ms>pans</ms>
            </fr> of
<m>rosette</m> and one of big bells' fine <m>metal</m>, where there is
more <m>rosette</m> than in small bells' <m>metal</m>. This <m>metal</m>
usually costs 15 <cn>pounds</cn> and fine <m>rosette</m> 15 or 16.</ab>

To level a cannon properly, one needs to have the mouth as high as the
breech. Otherwise, you do not aim well.

         <ab>The large canon is for great batteries and usually weighs fifty five
or 60 <ms>quintal</ms>s. The breech is two cannonball and three quarters
each. The mouth is one cannonball and three quarters each. It is
thirteen or fourteen <fr>
               <ms>pan</ms>s</fr> in length. But they are very
uneasy to drive. The proper battery, to be used rapidly and to have
great impact, is a hundred fifty to two hundred <ms>pace</ms>s. It is
true that a fair impact can be had from three or four hundred
<ms>pace</ms>s, but more <m>powder</m> is needed. Its usual load is 20
<ms>pound</ms>s of <m>powder</m>; its cannonball weighs 40
<ms>pound</ms>s, and 25 <al>horses</al> are required to carry it. When
one needs a longer range than the usual one, half a
<ms>
               <tl>linstock</tl>
            </ms> of canon <m>powder</m> is added. 80 or a
hundred shots can be made with this canon per day, but it needs to be
cooled down after each nine or ten shots if the battery is continuously
used; if there are some breaks, it is not necessary to refresh it as
often. For each <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>copper</m> - or one
<ms>quintal</ms> and a half for big cannons - a <ms>quintal</ms> of
<m>metal</m> is added. The <m>metal</m> is composed of eight
<ms>pound</ms>s of <m>tin</m> for each <ms>quintal</ms> of
<m>rosette</m> and even less for big bells for which we use only six
<ms>pound</ms>s of fine <m>tin</m> for a <ms>quintal</ms> of
<m>rosette</m>, to give it a louder voice. Because the more <m>tin</m>
there is, the clearer the sound is. For canon founding, if the material
and <m>charcoal</m> is provided as it is usually done because
<pro>master</pro>s cannot afford it, it costs 10 to 12 <cn>pound</cn>s
per <ms>quintal</ms>. And when the <pro>master</pro> provides
everything, you give him 40 <cn>pound</cn>s per <ms>quintal</ms> for big
pieces such as cannons, according to the King's ordinance. And 50
<cn>pound</cn>s for smaller pieces. For the more matter there is, the
more the <pro>master</pro> makes profit. Another kind of 30
<ms>quintal</ms>'s fowler is founded which is longer than the others,
and usually 8 <fr>
               <ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long, which is used to attack
fortifications and <fr>cassemattes</fr> by displaying them, at night, in
groups on the moat's edge.</ab>

         <ab> The <m>rosette</m> used to remelt is better than <m>rosette</m> for

            <margin>left-bottom</margin>

The older pieces are composed of almost as much of each, that is to say
a part of <m>rosette</m> and one of metal. This alloy can be recognized
with a <tl>burin</tl> because the matter is acid and the part scraped
off with the <tl>burin</tl> is yellow and white.</ab>

Culverines are big batteries of forty <ms>quintal</ms>s and eighteen
<fr>
               <ms>pan</ms>
            </fr>s long. Their bullet of the <ms>King's
standard</ms> and battery weighs 30 <ms>pound</ms>s and is therefore
lighter than the canon's one. Therefore, It does not carry so many
munitions because fifteen <ms>pound</ms>s are enough for its load. The
canon has a bigger mouth due to the size of its cannonball, but the
colverine is more precise and goes faster, having greater range due to
its length. Its breech is two bullets and a third thick, the front is a
bullet thick. Culverines are used for fighting fortifications from far
away when it is not possible to easily approach them. And then canons
come closer. They are used also to support the battery. Fifteen or
sixteen <al>horse</al>s are necessary to carry it. They are made of the
same metal alloy than the canon, like all others smaller pieces <sup>of
artillery</sup>. For these, we add a little bit more metal in order to
make the melting run better. And for two <ms>quintal</ms>s of
<m>rosette</m>, you add six unit of metal per pound for smaller pieces.
They range from 8 or 9 hundred <ms>pace</ms>s to a thousand
<ms>pace</ms>s if the <m>powder</m> is strong and in the air half a
<ms>league</ms>.</ab>

The <fr>bastarde</fr> is a middle-sized piece <sup>of artillery</sup>
which weighs thirty <ms>quintal</ms>s and its cannonballs weight 15
<ms>pound</ms>s and is loaded with 10 or 12 <ms>pound</ms>s of
<m>powder</m>. Its proportions are two cannonballs and a third part of a
third one thick at the breech and one cannonballs and three parts of two
at the front. They are used for fighting against less important defences
such as gabions or sentries, topped with a tower, or similar thing. It
is thirteen to fourteen <fr>
               <ms>pan</ms>
            </fr>s long like the great
cannon. Ten <al>horse</al>s are necessary to carry it. It goes with the

The <fr>bastarde culverine</fr> weights 35 <ms>quintal</ms>s and is 25
<fr>
               <ms>pan</ms>
            </fr>s long. The breech is three cannonballs thick and
the front two cannonballs. Its cannonball is like the bastard one,
weighing 15 <ms>pound</ms>s. These are fixed pieces which cannot be
carried on a carriage. They are for city defences. Some make cannons
like these which are 27 or 28 <fr>
               <ms>pan</ms>
            </fr>s long, like <pl>La
Rochelle</pl>'s <fr>vache</fr>, but such pieces are strengthened at the
breech with a width of three cannonballs. Their range is one
<ms>league</ms> and a half. Its load is like the <fr>bastarde</fr>'s
one, and if one wants to hit <pro>horsemen</pro> very far way, more
<m>powder</m> is added. After the cannonball there is a trace of smoke
which drives your trajectory to where the cannonball is going. This is
understood for cannons and the <fr>culverine</fr>, but not for small
pieces.</ab>

<fr>
               <ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. Its cannonball weighs eight or 9 pounds and
its load is six pounds of <m>powder</m>. The breech is three cannonballs
thick and the front is two. It is more appropriate against cities'
defence rather than in battery. It is however sometimes used either to
break a barricade or to support the battery after cannons have shot, in
order to prevent the assailled from rebuilding after the cannons have
played and shot. Four <al>horses</al> can carry it. It has a range of
eight or nine hundreds <ms>paces</ms> and almost as many as the
bastarde.</ab>

To cannons and big pieces we give as much <m>powder</m> as a cannonball
and a half's diameter in proportion to the <fr>escusson</fr>. For medium
pieces, such as campaign pieces, and the ones smaller, we provide them
with powder the equivalent of two cannonballs have a quantity of
<m>powder</m> equivalent to two cannonballs thick in proportion to the
<fr>passevolant</fr> and smaller ones are given three cannonballs thick
of <m>powder</m>. Usually, all pieces are loaded up to the escusson. We
load all pieces under 4 <fr>
               <ms>quintal</ms>s</fr> with the
<tl>linstock</tl>, two <tl>
               <ms>linstock</ms>s</tl> of cannon powder or
one and a half lantern of arquebus powder. For smaller ones, we only use
one <tl>

            </tl>. The pieces of one

A battlefield piece weighs ten or twelve <fr>

is ten or 12 <fr>
               <ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. Its cannonball weights 6 or 7
pounds and its loaded is 4 pounds of <m>powder</m>. The breech is three
cannonballs thick and the front is two, like all the pieces under the
mid-sized. The breech is thicker for they are in proportion longer and
also because they are more frequently used than big pieces against
houses or elsewhere. Their caliber is also small, so we give their
breech a thickness of three cannonballs. They are used to follow
immediately a camp and for the defence of cities and houses, settling
them on walls or in a tower. Three good <al>horses</al> are required to
carry it.</ab>

         <ab>

The passevolant weighs 6 <fr>
               <ms>quintal</ms>s</fr> and is eight or nine
<fr>
               <ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. Its cannonball weighs two pounds, and its
load is a pound and a half of <m>powder</m>. The breech is three
cannonballs thick and the front two. Two <al>horses</al> can carry it
because one single horse can't carry a piece. It is used for houses'
defence or to be brought amongst the infantry to break a horsemen
rank.</ab>

quarter, its load is half a pound of <m>powder</m>. The breech is three
cannonballs thick and the front two. To carry it, two <al>horses</al>,
altough these pieces are seldom moved since they are manly used to
defend houses. The ones which are carried over for battery or a fight,
or a siege, are culverines, medium-sized bastardes and pieces</ab>

which are under three <fr>
               <ms>quintal</ms>s</fr> are at least three

less. The breech is three cannonballs thick, and the front two. It is
loaded with as much <m>powder</m> as cannonballs, to the top of the
touch line, which is equivalent for such small pieces to 3 or 4 arquebus
<m>powder</m> cannonballs, because if canon <m>powder</m> is used, it

This has to be understood as <m>iron</m> cannonballs. When a metal
cannonball is fired, we overload it with a quarter of
<tl>
               <ms>linstock</ms>
            </tl> because if a cannonball weighs 40 pounds, a
metal one weights 60 pounds. This is why the sight is higher when a
metal cannonball is fired. Because if an <m>iron</m> cannonball is fired
directly, a metal cannonball is shot from six lines higher. A metal
cannonball, mixed with <m>copper</m> to make it more brittle, is more
effective at close range than the <m>iron</m> one. But an <m>iron</m>
one is more effective at long range. </ab>

         <ab>You must have some <m>millet</m> soaked in order to remove the

again quite finely and pass through a cloth <tl>sieve</tl>. One must
soak the <m>flour</m> with fresh melted <m>butter</m> and some
<m>milk</m> so that it is very light, like the <m>pastry</m> to make
<m>beignets</m>, and add <m>egg yolk</m> depending on the amount of
<m>flour</m>, so that there are two <m>egg yolks</m> for each
<m>millas</m>. Then you will put in some <m>
               <pa>saffron</pa>
            </m> if you

         <ab>Afterwards you must have some <tl>mold</tl>s, which must be made
from <m>terra<sup>cotta</sup>
            </m>, in the shape of the bottom of the
catholic hat, but it must be open at both ends. And then, having made a
good fire, clean where you want to put your <m>millas</m> and then take
your <tl>mold</tl>s and grease them very well so that the <m>pastry</m>
does not stick to them when baked. Once you have done that, put your
<tl>mold</tl>s in a place in the <tl>oven</tl> where you clean and
sprinkle a bit of <m>flour</m> on the bottom and fill them with some of
the aforementioned <m>pastry</m>. Then you will cover the said
<tl>mold</tl>s, with a <tl>lid</tl> made like the <tl>mold</tl>, but it
must be bigger and not open at the top. Then once done, you will put
some <m>straw</m> on the said <tl>lid</tl> and a lot of hot
<m>charcoal</m>, and set a fire around it, once done, you will open up
one of them after a bit of time and will see when it is baked, it will

         <ab>As for small cannons that are not loaded with a linstock, one loads
them with <m>powder</m> all the way up to the touch hole, which is
placed at a point on the cannon that indicates the appropriate
measure.</ab>

         <ab>To point a cannon, that is to say to fix the target, one needs to
set the sights, in other words, take aim, from the sides rather than the
top, that is to say the top of the cannon. By taking aim from the top,
you can find the line of fire that leads to your target, but you will
not find out if the cannon leans more to one side or the other. Then
take your sights first from one side and then from the other and adjust
your cannon to point at your intended target. Then set your sights from
the top of the breech, which will be quickly done. Next, use your
discretion to lower the cannon a little if you are within firing range,
because the force of the <m>powder</m> blast usually raises the barrel.
If you are outside of the range in which the cannon can fire in a direct
line, you should consider that the weight of the cannonball will lower
the barrel.</ab>

         <head>Shooting a cannon at night</head>

         <ab>Some keep their cannons loaded <del>and</del>in the daylight hours.
Then, so that the <pro>cannoneer</pro> can shoot into the breach where
the besieged are perhaps reparing <x>the breach</x>, the assailants
raise a false alarm so that the besieged throw torches or <m>artificial
fire</m> into the moats or around the breach, light by which the
<pro>cannoneer</pro> can take aim. Sometimes by using the reflection off
<tl>mirrors</tl> or <tl>jars</tl> full of <m>water</m>, the assailants
can redirect the light onto the breach. The method that you know, using
a sundial and <m>lead</m> line, is also very good. Others use strong
<m>iron</m> pegs to fix two or three planks onto a platform of
<m>wood</m> made to carry a battery of cannon, and leave some notches
empty where the cannon wheels can pass perfectly. And with this method
you will always put the cannon in such a position so that it doesn't
tilt to the right or the left. And so that it isn't too high or low when
you fire the following day, you place a marker that is well fixed in the
ground, that just touches the bottom edge of the canon after it has been
aimed and adjusted for firing.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-bottom</margin>If the platform, the wheels or wedge
parts break or come loose, this invention holds no advantage.</ab>

         <ab>Others place two well-staked poles into the earth in such a way that
the one is as far from the edge of the cannon's mouth as the other. And
underneath they place the above-mentioned ruler. Then when want to fire
the cannon at night, they push their cannon straight towards the
above-mentioned ruler and make it so that the edge of the mouth rests on
the end of the aforesaid ruler. Next, they measure with a ruler, or a
similar tool with measured intervals, from one pole to the side of the
cannon and if it is too close or too far, they adjust the canon and make
it the same distance as from the other pole.</ab>

         <head>Unspiking your cannon</head>

         <ab>Some people say that one should remove the cannonball if the cannon
is loaded and introduce fire into the mouth of the cannon. But it is
probable that the fire will leave again through the mouth rather than
seek its exit through the touch hole which is spiked and restricted. The
most reliable way is that the <pro>cannoneer</pro>, who is often a
<pro>founder</pro>, drive in a <m>nail</m> and turn back the point of
the <m>nail</m> that the enemies placed therein, and with a
<tl>trephine</tl>, make another touch hole at the side of the spiked
one, which can be done in an hour. And if with time the violence of the
<m>powder</m> loosens the <m>nail</m> that the cannon was spiked with,
you will make a nut in the second touchhole and place a <m>screw</m> in
it, so perfectly that it will never come undone.</ab>

         <head>Defense of a town</head>

         <ab>There is nothing more efficient for defending a breach than mortars
placed at the front line, as soon as the initial assault. They carry a
lot of ammunition and are filled with cart <m>nails</m>, big
<m>steel</m> dice, bits of <m>chains</m> and similar items. And when one
senses that the enemy is close, one lights everything on fire. Grenades,
well-constructed and thrown at the right moment, also cause much damage.
And to make them worse, one can add some roughly crushed <m>glass</m>,
either in the mold or in the crucible, when one casts them. This worsens
the wounds. The grenades must not be too brittle, but it is good that
they be somewhat alloyed with the material of the grenade so that
instead of breaking up, they resist shock better and inflict more
violence.</ab>

And through these notches is fit the harquebus’s hook which has a hole
through which we pass, from under, <m>iron</m> pegs. When you want to
aim, you affuste the middle and side ones. If you want to make double,
triple or four ranks or more, you have to put similar board rank one on
the other, like the first one. This manner of making an orgue fait faute
@ and makes it very stable. Because the other ones made of one massive
and solid piece have cannons of only one and a half pan long. They
therefore are used only for a salvo at an entrance or to protect a
gate.</ab>

         <ab>

A small hooked harquebus a-crocke weighs 40 <ms>pounds</ms> and is 4
<fr>
               <ms>pans</ms>
            </fr> long, and is to be loaded to the touch hole, its
breech is three cannonballs thick, its front two.</ab>

         <ab>

The double cannon is nothing different from the big ordinary cannon,
apart from the fact that its cannonball has one <ms>line</ms> of
thickness - or of diametre - more. A <ms>line</ms> is a <ms>twelfth
part</ms> of a cannonball. At the breech, it has a thickess of one
<ms>line</ms> more than the cannon, and the mouth is half a
<ms>line</ms> thicker. Its load is six or seven <ms>lbs</ms> of
<m>powder</m>, more than a cannon, that is to say of two big linstocks.
Its cannonball weighs 56 <ms>lb</ms>. Thirty <al>horses</al> are
necessary to carry it. It weakens the walls more than a cannon. But it
is very uneasy to drive. This is why it is unused today and is more
appropriate to be brought to a nearby place for close combat or for a
<x>ceremonial</x> entry, rather than for an ordinary execution. They are
called basilics, and they are unmovable pieces.</ab>

         <ab>A mortar is made so that it weighs three <ms>quintals</ms> and
carries a cannonball flat on the side from which it must exit and round
on the side of the cannon, as if it was a cannonball cut in half. It is
two pans long. It has to be loaded with xxv <ms>lb</ms> of powder
because it has to be full to the opening and has to fire. Its bottom is
not thicker than the opening and is made of one single piece. Its
material has to be better than other artillery pieces, and for 4
<ms>quintals</ms> of fine <m>copper</m> there must only be one quintal
of <m>metal</m> so that it absorbs the shock, and so that, when fired
with more force, it is more efficient. It has to be used against a door
with a large <m>iron</m> cross before the bullet, and once loaded, needs
to be covered with a firmly sewed rough <m>canvas</m> which should be
completely smeared with <m>turpentine</m>. Four handles need to be added
to it while it is cast, it is thus easier to place. The <m>iron</m>
cross is fixed to the opening with the <m>canvas</m> covering it. The
handles have to be held at its opening's edge, as you can see. To place
it, you need three or four <m>iron</m> 
            <tl>pegs</tl> of one
<fr>
               <ms>pan</ms>

which have their point like a <tl>gimlet</tl>, and their body like a
screw as they are strongly pulled, and a ring on the other side to turn
them with a short <tl>stick</tl> that fits into the <tl>ring</tl>. And
the <tl>pegs</tl> are fixed on the door, not straight, because they
would not have any strength, but crooked as if you wanted to fix them
towards the middle of the <m>mortar</m>, and to do the holes of the
handles need to be quite large. In that way, the shooting <m>mortar</m>
pushes the <tl>pegs</tl> back and forth into the door, and makes more
damage. Once in place, you need to have <fr>saucisse de
<m>buckram</m>
            </fr> @ made in this manner: take eight or nine
<fr>

         <head>Grenades</head>

         <ab>Grenades should be made from the finest metal you can find, for
there is fine metal and rough metal. Fine metal is that of big bells,
because one puts in more <m>copper</m> to give them a bigger voice, and
for small bells one puts more <m>tin</m> to give them a clearer sound.
The metal of big bells is made with 3 quintals of <m>rosette</m> and
twenty or xxv lb. of <m>tin</m>. Each grenade should weigh four to six
lb. In order to throw them, they must be full of powder mixed with
coarsely pounded glass. And in a quarter lb. of powder, one must put
half an ounce of glass, so that on the face or places where the powder
will have an effect, the wounds will be worse. The best harquebus powder
is required. The hole needs to be as large as the thickness of a swan's
feather, and there is no need to make it into a screw, it is enough to
make it even. Then you make a pipe of well soldered <m>fer blanc</m>,
which can enter into the hole up to the middle of the grenade and which
juts out the width of one finger. You will fill it with good powder,
pounded in a mortar and lightly tempered with good <m>spirits</m> or
strong <m>vinegar</m>. One does so in order to slow down the powder. And
in order to know if it will be slow enough to allow time to throw the
grenade without danger, try this powder thus tempered in another pipe.
You can keep your loaded grenades in a very dry place, and on the
contrary you should keep your pipes filled with that tempered powder
tight together in a humid place. And nonetheless, you should have some
already inserted into grenades, so that you are always equipped. And
every 3 days you will change them if you notice they have become too
dry. To throw your grenade, take it firmly in one hand and with the
other hand light your pipe with a wick, and throw it swiftly amidst the
troops. The grenade should have twice the thickness of a knife
spine.<lb/>

         <ab>

It requires a hundred <pro>roadworkers</pro> or more to even gap tracks
and others obstacles such as <pa>trees</pa>, <m>stone</m> piles and
similar things to make gabions on the road. Once one is close to the
battlefield, the <pro>gunner</pro> goes at night to locate the most
convenient place to display the battery and if he does find one, a false
alarm should be raised so the ones inside throw torches. Very often,

you shoot as strong as possible so the assailed despising the battery do
not fix it. Usually, there are not many gun-turrets or other defenses.
And when a breach is made at the strongest and the cannon replaced, it
will surprise the assailed. One should approach fortified towns at
night, but <ill/>. The workers bring gabions and once these are
displayed, some boards or plank are put behind gabions to keep the
workers safe while behind, they fill the gabions with some <m>earth</m>
by means of their shovels. And while this is being performed, another
false alarm is raised from another side. And once you have shot a cannon
ball at the defense, the gabions the <pro>workers</pro> display the
boards to make a plain ground or a platform of four fingers or half a
foot thick. And they are set into the <m>earth</m>. The platform is five
or six feet larger than the cannon's wheels on each side if there is
just one cannon. But if there are more, platformes are side by side. The
space between the pieces is equivalent to the width of two gabions. As
long as the battery lasts, <pro>gunner</pro>s sleep and eat close to a
cannon. In small spaces, one does not bother to dig trenches to reach
the pieces but display many high gabions and run towards them. In large
places one digs trenches. There are always in trenches or behind
barricades units on guard duty to defend the pieces. A small
<m>powder</m> container is kept containing three or four separate
cags.</ab>

arquebus bulletproof board between two gabions. Then, with a lantern, a
<pro>gunner</pro> reloads it, and with the ramer which is at the other
end of the lantern, two men press as hard as they can, nine of ten
pushes, until the <m>powder</m> is dense Then another one adds some
<m>hay</m> or <m>straw</m> and the others ram for a while. Another one
loads the cannon ball. And the one with the <m>hay</m> adds the same
amount and presses again. Another one adds a <m>wood</m> hung but this
might damage the piece. And if one has to shoot a lot, one would need
many hungs which are heavy to bring. When the cannon is loaded, xx or
xxv <pro>workers</pro> push it forward with the sticks by the side,
behind the gabions without taking off the board until the cannon reaches
it. Once the cannon is forward, the <pro>gunner</pro> adjusts it with
the hooks at the back, pointing at the target on each side and then in
the middle.Then another one nearby sets fire. Each <pro>gunner</pro>
needs 3 <pro>cannoners</pro>: one to load, one to point at the target
and one to set fire. Sometimes, against a camp where breaches are made,
one shoots a cartridges, as you find elsewhere, or one may use a basket
full of <m>stones</m>, <m>cars' nails</m> or similar things. A cannon
must not be carried unless it is with two <m>wood</m> or <m>iron</m>
carriages. And you need seven quintals and a half of <m>iron</m> to fill
the cannon's wheels, flasques and other equipage. The best battery is,
according to some people, made as a curtain which sideways, because by
doing so you unsettle more stones.</ab>

Some add small wheels to a piece and a thick board to the end of the
piece so it can be moved quicker and without noise. Others add some
leather around the wheels and also add soles or leather shoes to the
horses' hooves so they cannot be heard.</ab>

         <head>Gunner</head>

         <ab>There are three rings on a cannon, one at the breech, one in the
middle, one at the mouth. When founders want to work on their piece or
have a cannon or another lighter piece and easier to carry, they make it
from the breech ring to the middle one in the same size and proportions
as the bullets described below. But they taper it more or less one line
on each side from the middle ring to the mouth ring, always using a
compass for their measures from the straight line which they draw in the
<fr>
               <tl>modelle en <m>papier</m>
               </tl>
            </fr> whatever pattern. And this
reduction is consequently equivalent to seven or eight <ms>quintals</ms>
less. And this does not make the piece less secure. This is done for big
pieces, but for pieces smaller than the mid-one, one has to keep the
aforesaid proportion and make the piece in one straight line from one
end to the other. Usually the trunnions are situated one foot away from
the middle ring in the direction of the breech.

But since some gunners prefer a piece heavier at the front for it is
easier to adjust and for that purpose, it is sufficient to place the
trunnions closer to the breech and further away from the middle. On the
contrary if you want to make it heavier at the bottom, you will place
the trunnions

closer to the middle of the piece or forward in direction of the mouth.
When you drill your piece make a fluted cast <m>iron</m> bar like a bed
poster and and there must be sixteen flutes or notches in which you will
fix sixteen well-even blades, so altogether they will cut and scrape
similarly. Because should some not cut or scrape, there would be some
waves and spaces in the cannon which would be bent and the piece might
break in its middle. In order to avoid this the drill has to go evenly
from the breech to the mouth and the piece's mouth must be evenly hard
so the <m>powder</m> will be released at once with more strength. On the
contrary, if it is blocked it goes sideways and makes the piece
break.</ab>

         <ab>They are better when shaped as the crucible with a narrow bottom and
a larger mouth. You have to strongly crush the powder and add either
some sand or some <m>cork</m> or even better a <m>pure pierced wax
plate</m> because it seals well up and is more efficient. A bullet just
makes a hole, the <m>powder</m> only is more efficient. One knows that

         <ab>They deem the best <m>tin</m> is the one that comes in
<fr>saulmons</fr>, which has not been remelted since it came from the
<env>mine</env>, because the masters remelt it <del>a</del> in
<tl>
               <fr>grilles</fr>
            </tl>, weighing two or three <ms>lb</ms>, to easily
cut it up and sell it by the piece. And in this they often mix in
leftovers from <m>plates</m>, <m>soldering</m> &amp; <m>common tin</m>.
And to recognise the best one, it is the most lustrous, which looks
burnished, because it is the softest. Sometimes in their
<fr>saulmons</fr> they find pieces of <m>iron</m>, stones, &amp; similar
things mixed in, to cheat on the weight. The <m>tin from
<pl>England</pl>
            </m> is so hard that the <pro>miners</pro> put in
<m>lead</m> to soften it. The one that comes by way of <pl>Germany</pl>
is softer. Usually, the <pro>sworn master pewterers</pro>, from
<env>
               <fr>bonnes villes</fr>
            </env>, add six <ms>lb</ms> of <m>fine
lead</m> 
            <del>on</del> or eight on a <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>fine
tin</m>. The <pro>others, who work in the <env>countryside</env>
            </pro>,
put fifteen or 20 or as much as they can, and to cover up the blackness
of the <m>lead</m> 
            <del>they</del> and its softness, they put in
<m>looking-glass tin</m>, 4 <ms>lb</ms> per <ms>quintal</ms>,

               <fr>po</fr>

open the <tl>molds</tl> so that they do not heat up, &amp; having taken
out the cast which is on the female side, &amp; which breaks easily.
Then, with a <tl>cloth</tl> which soaks in <m>water</m>, which they
always have beside them, they rub the middle of the back of the dish

When the <m>tin is fine</m>, one adds less <m>glass-looking tin</m>,

         <ab>

If there is not a lot of <m>looking-glass tin</m>, one puts about two or

            </m>
because it is more humid and does not make the paste as brittle, and
sprinkle your <m>tragacanth gum</m> with it, &amp; continue to grind
<add>and mix in</add> thus, little by little, <del>
               <fr>le et mesler
legi</fr>
            </del> the very finely sieved <m>flour</m>. And knead it as if
you wanted to make <m>bread</m>, until <del>you</del> you perceive that
it has enough body &amp; is as firm as <m>bread dough</m> that one is
ready to put in the <tl>oven</tl>. This is perceivable when it can
stretch enough without breaking. And if it was not strong enough, it
would not <del>
               <fr>sti</fr>
            </del> release well. Thus once prepared, rub
the cavity <del>
               <fr>au u</fr>
            </del> with <m>oil</m>, with a
<tl>brush</tl>, so that the <m>oil</m> penetrates everywhere to make it
release better, and press the paste inside quite hard. And if it does
not release well, mix in more <m>flour</m> until it has enough body.
With this you will mold whatever work you like, masks or garlands, which
will be dry within one <ms>day</ms>. Next, you will apply them with
<m>strong glue</m> or <m>paste glue</m>, as you like, and you will be
able to paint and decorate them with <m>gold</m> &amp; all colors. In
<pl>Rome</pl> they make ceiling and wall ornaments with it. One can make
bed ornaments with it. <rub>If you want that the work stays white</rub>,
it is better to mold with <m>plaster</m> instead of <m>flour</m>. It is
true that it is more brittle and firm as well, but one needs to prepare
it like this: temper it, when it is powdered <del>strong</del>, in a
good amount of <m>water</m> so that it is <add>clear</add>, &amp; grind
it several times a day for fifteen <ms>days</ms>. Then pour off the
<m>water</m> by tilting, and gather the <m>plaster</m> &amp; grind it
finely on the <tl>
               <m>marble</m>
            </tl>, &amp; place it in some kind of
clean <tl>
               <m>lead</m> vessel</tl>, so that no dust &amp; dirt falls into
it, &amp; leave it <env>in the open air</env> &amp; <env>
               <fr>au
serain</fr>
            </env> for fifteen <ms>days</ms> with its <m>water</m>, and
it will become matte, strong, white and light, very suitable for making
a groundlayer for burnished <m>gold</m>. And this, in powder form, you
can mix, instead of <m>flour</m>, with <m>tragacanth gum</m>, and your
work will be very beautiful. Lacking <m>plaster</m>, you can mix in well
ground <m>chalk</m> or <m>ceruse</m>, &amp; try <m>bole</m> &amp;
similar things. This <m>stucco</m> with the <m>tragacanth gum</m> has
the quality, being malleable before being dry, of fitting on either
round or flat things, as you like. It is to make an ornament at little
expense.

         <ab>Two kinds are made in <pl>Toulouse</pl>, one to cover rooms' walls
which are finely woven, almost like <m>straw</m> hats worn by villagers,
and are made in long rolls, some 10 <m>straws</m> wide, others 13. And
they work on them mainly in summer and winter. Then when they prepare it
they sew it, but beforehand they dye it in usually three colours: green,
red and sometimes purple. The green one is made with only a <m>pastel
tincture</m> since green is made from yellow and blue, so the
<m>pastel</m> dyes the dark yellow <m>straw</m>. It becomes bright
green. For red they use some <m>alum</m> and <m>brazil wood</m>, for
purple they use <m>pastel</m> and some <m>coperous</m> which darkens
blue with its black tincture.</ab>

pewter</m>, <m>lead rocks</m>, &amp; some <m>iron file dust</m>. This
red is to be applied on both sides of the <m>glass</m> because it is

flow through the tip, but before, you must have pressed your thumb well
over the hole on the top edge, because in this way, by the compression
of air, the wine will be retained between the double walls. Then with a

Take a box of boxwood banded with rings, as you see, into which will
easily fit another small box, like that which you see marked B, and make
sure that it does not touch the bottom of the large one marked A, but
that there is some distance. That which enters the large box must be
smooth, but the rim must be made with rings so that, being joined, it
appears as if they are one and the same box. You must also have a round
<m>leather</m> cover of the same length as the box, as you see marked C,
which will fit easily &amp; surround the aforesaid boxes thus placed one
within the other. But before you do your trick, you must put at the
bottom of the larger box powdered <m>gold</m> or <m>silver</m>, or
<m>mercury</m> amalgamated with <m>silver</m>, and then place the little
box marked B on top. After, holding the box with your index finger on
top, you present it, and seeing only the bottom of the smaller box
marked B, one places a jewel or something similar in it. This being
done, placing the box on the table, you cover it with the leather box,
and making the requisite gestures, you will remove the leather box, &amp;
without showing the inside, will put it on the table &amp; let it be
recognized that the jewel is placed in the bottom of the small box
marked B. Then you will gently place the leather box back, &amp; after
saying inhonorificabilitidinita<del>d</del>tudinibus, you will take the
top of the leather box with two fingers, and clasping it more firmly
than usual, at the same time you will lift the smaller box that is
inside &amp; which contains the jewel, &amp; you will gently put both on the
table, then you will pour the powder or amalgam that is at the bottom of
the large box, then replace the leather box with the box inside it, as
it was at the start. Then, removing the leather box without removing the
smaller one, you will show the jewel at the bottom which has returned to
its previous state, holding your index finger on the rim of the box so
that it does not slip.</ab>

make a tripod in a camp with three halberd tips. If the edge of the
knife marked A faces from right to left, the butts of the handles will
rise, but if the edge of the same knife faces from left to right, the

grain pass into the bell, which you will have tapped shortly before on

         <ab>Make a small sheath of plain leather, such as cow or morocco,
somewhat thick, as tall as three fingers, sewn like the finger of a
glove &amp; large enough that two fingertips can fit inside &amp; which,
at the tip, which is a little puckered, has a round hole as large as a
double liard. Take two similar <m>boxwood</m> balls, &amp; let one be
hollow &amp; open with a round hole on one side only so that the thimble
can fit inside. Thus, when you want to perform, you will place your
<m>leather</m> sheath on the table with the ball that is not hollow.
Pass a stick inside the <m>leather</m> sheath to show that there is
nothing there, also show the full ball, and hold the one which is hollow
&amp; has the thimble inside it by your little &amp; ring fingers, and
do this with your right hand with which you are holding the stick.
After, you take your <m>leather</m> sheath &amp; place it over the
hollow ball which is in your fingers, &amp; making it seem as if you are
putting some <m>
               <la>oribus</la> powder</m> over it, you put back the
<m>leather</m> mold that contains the ball with the thimble on the
table, then you take the full &amp; solid ball remaining on the table,
and command it to enter from under the table into the <m>leather</m>
sheath. Then, lifting the <m>leather</m>, the ball seems to be the same,
although it is the hollow one. Then cover it again &amp; command it to
become invisible. And then, lifting the sheath while pressing it, you
will remove it and the ball along with it; &amp; putting it aside with
the sheath, in its place will be found a thimble for the ladies whose
bottom hurts, that is to say, the bottom of the needle.</ab>

         <ab>It is said that in <pl>Lorraine</pl> &amp; <pl>Flanders</pl>
            <m>linking glass</m> is made of <m>
               <pa>fern</pa> ashes</m> &amp;
<m>pebbles</m>. First they blow up a long still that another worker
breaks off and cuts vertically with big shears. Then this long still
expands by being placed on a <tl>
               <m>stone</m>
            </tl> or large
<tl>platine</tl> in a <tl>furnace</tl> slightly colder than one for
melting. Furthermore, they flatten it by rolling <sup>over</sup> it a
big &amp; long <tl>
               <m>iron</m> stick</tl>. Then they take it out of the
annealing <tl>furnace</tl>. Similarly, they make some in
<pl>England</pl> that are quite beautiful. Close to <pl>Rouen</pl> in
<pl>France</pl>, <m>flat glass</m> is made with some <del>
               <fr>sel

               <pa>saltworth</pa>
            </m> &amp; <m>pebbles</m> and is
whiter &amp; softer than the <pl>Lorraine</pl> one, because it can be
melted with a <tl>candle</tl>, unlike the <pl>Lorraine</pl> one. This
<m>flat glass</m> is blown up in a long still -- the end of which
someone else cuts and blows up whilst turning it, then flattens it using
a <tl>plane</tl> which is on the ground, <del>A</del> and then reheats
it. Thus the middle of the still, where it began, always stays the
same.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-middle</margin>The <m>glass</m>, when wet, can be
broken again with the flame of a <tl>candle</tl>, but not as precisely
as with <tl>hot <m>iron</m>

         <ab>The <m>metal</m> whitens the more it is melted, because the
<m>tin</m> does not go away but rather mixes in more. And, by holding it
a long time in the fire, the <m>filth</m> is eaten away, which makes it
brittle. If you want to chase away the <m>tin</m> from the
<m>copper</m>, after it is well hot, throw in <m>saltpeter</m> often.
This only &amp; not the fire separates it, &amp; purifies it, &amp; eats
the <m>filth</m> away. The <m>metal</m> is cast very neatly. The
<m>copper</m> is prone to swell, but because it is soft, it can be fixed
with a <tl>hammer</tl>.</ab>

Some do not lay <m>gris d'escaille</m> on the <m>glass</m> to work on
it, but trace straight on the <m>glass</m> with <m>noir à huile</m>.
However, it is important that the <m>wood</m> be degreased, because if
it has even a little <m>grease</m> 
            <sup>on it</sup>, the color will not
take at all. And even, if the working <pro>glassmaker</pro> has a
<sn>stink</sn> from his <bp>nose</bp> or his <bp>mouth</bp>

               <fr>la</fr>
            </del>, &amp; he <bp>breathes</bp> on the <m>glass</m>,
the color will not take on it. Those who came up with the invention of
working in small works of softened <m>enamels</m> use only <m>azure
enamel</m>, which is blue, &amp; <m>esmail colombin</m>, which is the
color of purple, which they soften with <m>rocks</m> or <m>lead
glass</m>. As for yellow, they make it from <m>silver</m>, red from
<m>sanguine</m>, as is said elsewhere, black &amp; gray &amp; shadows
from <m>scale black</m>, either strong or weak, carnation from <m>light
sanguine</m>. Green is made first from yellow, then they overlay
<m>azure enamel</m>, either strong or weak, depending on whether they
want to make it bright or dark.

         <ab>The orangeish color that is in <m>transparent amber</m> and in the
other one that has body is not internal, for on the inside it is
whitish. But through age <del>it</del> or wearing it, it acquires this
reddish crust. This is why those who cut it with the <tl>file</tl> or on
the <tl>wheel</tl> do not remove, if it is possible, this crust. But
they only polish it, rubbing it with a <tl>

its color, hang it inside a <env>chimney</env> where there is much
<m>soot</m> &amp; <m>smoke</m>, and it will take on a reddish-orange
color. Try to take the most whitish transparent one, and put it under

<env>in a closed space</env>, in the <m>smoke of <fr>safre</fr>

one alternately does <pa>
               <fr>pastel</fr> woad</pa> and <pa>wheat</pa>
there. For the cultivation of <pa>
               <fr>pastel</fr> woad</pa>, one works
the soil with <tl>
               <m>iron</m> shovels</tl>, as <pro>gardeners</pro> do.
Next, one harrows it with <tl>rakes</tl>, &amp; breaks it up finely as
for sowing <pa>cooking herbs</pa>. One commonly sows it <tmp>on
<pn>Saint Anthony</pn>'s day in January</tmp>. One makes eight harvests
of it. The first ones are better. The best <pa>
               <fr>pastel</fr> woad</pa>
of <pl>Lauragais</pl> is the one from <pl>Carmail</pl> &amp; the one

is good <env>in one field &amp; in the one close by it</env> will hardly

when, put in the <bp>mouth</bp>, it gives a <sn>taste as of
<m>vinegar</m>

mold-like veins which are as if golden or silver. One assays it in the

needs six <ms>balls</ms> of it. One dyes several <ms>locks</ms> of
<m>wool</m>, and if it dyes fifteen times, it is said to be fifteen
<cn>florins</cn>, if it gives xx dyings, xx <cn>florins</cn>. The good

         <ab>If you want to trace some history in intaglio on <m>glass</m>, you
can do it in different ways. Lay your <m>glass pane</m> 
            <del>on</del>,
the thinnest you can find, on the printed history, &amp; having cleaned
the <m>glass</m> well with <m>lye</m> &amp; <m>ash</m> so that it is not
greasy, trace over the lines visible to you with <m>
               <fr>noir à
huile</fr>
            </m> or <m>
               <fr>noir d’escaille</fr>
            </m> with the
<tl>
               <fr>pinceau</fr>
            </tl>, if you want to paint with colors in the
manner of <pro>glaziers</pro>, who wash their <m>glass pane</m> with
<m>
               <fr>noir d’escaille</fr>
            </m> &amp; then scrape &amp; clear the parts
which they want to coat with color, leaving that which is necessary for
shading. But if you want to make <m>gilt</m> histories on <m>glass</m>
with a background of colors, which imitates the <fr>basse-taille</fr> of
<pro>goldsmiths</pro>, <m>gild</m> your entire <m>glass pane</m> with
<m>gum water</m> or <m>
               <pa>garlic</pa> juice</m> or <m>
               <pa>fig-tree</pa>
milk</m>. Then moisten your printed history between two wet
<tl>
               <m>
                  <pl>linen</pl> cloths</m>
            </tl> &amp; lay it down on the <m>gilt
glass</m>. Then with a <tl>pin</tl> mounted on the end of a small
<tl>stick</tl>, follow the lines of your history as if you wanted to
pounce it, &amp; thus you shall exactly trace it on the <m>gilding of
the glass</m>. &amp; next you shall clear the background &amp; that
which needs to be blank with a quite pointy <tl>
               <m>steel</m> awl</tl>,
&amp; and neatly follow once more the lines &amp; accomplish your work
&amp; fashion your faces &amp; flesh tones in pounded <m>silver</m>;
then you shall fill the background with <m>
               <fr>azur d’esmail</fr>
            </m> or
<m>verdigris</m> or <m>fine <fr>laque platte</fr>
            </m>
            <del>
               <fr>platte</fr>
            </del> tempered with <m>clear turpentine</m>, mixed
with a little of <m>tear of mastic</m> if you want that the colors hold
together more &amp; not to spread. Next, layer on the back of the
<m>glass</m> &amp; over the colors a <m>white tin</m> sheet. And once
this is dry, you can cover the <m>tin</m> sheet <del>of</del> with color
to hide your secret. The <m>tin</m> sheet gives light to the colors.
Thus you will be able to paint without being</ab>

One always needs to reheat the <m>earths</m> before casting.</ab>

         <ab>The sand chosen <del>cast</del> for casting should be neither so
lean that it has no stickiness, nor too fat. And even if it is found
<env>

            </env>, however, it is not everywhere. And if you
are in a place where it is not found, you can make it, but not with
<m>fat earth</m>, for the sand does not want any of that, for it makes
it very porous. But you can make it bindable with <m>brick well
ground</m> on <tl>
               <m>marble</m>
            </tl>, or <m>plaster</m> or <m>calcinated
alabaster</m> or something similar, or the <m>burned marrow of
<al>ox</al> horn</m> or <m>burned asphalt</m>. If you grind it quite
finely on <tl>

            </tl>, it <del>
               <fr>s</fr>
            </del> acquires
stickiness better &amp; then you can burn it with <m>asphalt</m> or mix
it with a <ms>quarter part</ms> of <m>tripoli</m>. Guard against
<m>bread</m> falling into your sand because it makes it very

neatly. When you work, <del>the humid</del> the exhalation of your
<bp>breath</bp> moistens the leaf layered on the <m>glass</m>, &amp;
therefore it would be good, while working, to heat it up a few times.
You need to be very careful to wash that which you want to be blank
&amp; serve as a background for painting with colors, for if it were not
quite clean of the <m>gum</m>'s greasiness &amp; viscosity,
<del>the</del> &amp; of other things, the colors would not be so brisk
on it. To advance your works, you can <fr>ponce</fr>, or, better still,
layer the <m>gum</m> &amp; leaf on a cut <m>paper</m>. In this way, you
will need to repair very little. If you want to make <m>gold</m> color

         <ab>To shoot your arquebus precisely the end of the breech must come
precisely on the edge of the light, because like this the <m>powder</m>
catches <x>fire</x> and burns all at once without blowing and has more
strength and does not recoil. On the contrary, if the breech is made
hollow, as they commonly are, the <m>powder</m> catches more quickly in
this place, makes it recoil, and blows. This is clearly shown <x>by</x>
a arquebus with a chamber which recoils more than another. And since the
cannon is bigger at the breech than at the muzzle the sights are also
uneven, because that at the breech is higher than that at the muzzle.
Additionally, the thickness of the cannon is greater than the caliber by
about one line, and the sight by another. It would therefore be
necessary to either make the cannon all of one size or to raise the
barrel from the end and towards the muzzle, and push it in and lower
towards the breech. The weight of the <m>powder</m> must be one third of
the <x>weight of the</x> bullet.

         <ab>It is necessary to make a <m>wooden</m> pipe 4 or 5 fingers wide
that is perfectly hollow, according to the open end of your barrel, of
the form represented in A. Then, having cut some <m>paper</m>, which has
to be as strong as that of large printed books, in the form indicated in
D and as wide as you want your cartridge to be long, wrap the
<m>paper</m> around the baton B and at the top, where the pointed tip F
will be around the aforementioned <m>paper</m>, and the cartridge will
be formed. But, in order to make the bottom more uniform, put it into
pipe A, then introduce baton B and, in the other end of the pipe, which
is marked G, insert baton C and pack so as to compact and press the
folded tip of your cartridge, then take it out, and the charge in this,
put three or four drageons or larmes. Then, with a punch, marked E, of
the same caliber of your arquebus or pistol, punch round pieces on
<m>cardboard</m> or <m>felt</m> or <m>waxed cloth</m>, and put this
round piece into your cartridge, and push it until the drageons with the
baton B, the more drageons, 3 or 4, then a round piece. And continue
like that until the cartridge is full, the put it into the arquebus. If
you want your pellet to scatter earlier, make round pieces out of
<m>paper</m>. If you want it to reach further without scattering, make
the piece out of <m>cardboard</m>. If you want it to reach even further,
make the round piece out of <m>waxed cloth</m>, or either of
<m>leather</m> or <m>felt</m>, and a piece of <m>waxed cloth</m> on the
top. And if you make the cartridge in part with <m>waxed cloth</m> or
<m>waxed paper</m>, it will reach one hundred paces and will make a big
hole, and the <m>pellet</m>, barely scattering, will produce a big
opening. But if you make your cartridge with <m>waxed cloth</m> or a
material stronger than <m>paper</m>, it cannot be so long, with the
<m>cardboard</m> tip being like in D, because it is enough if it wrapped
around twice. In such a way, the <m>pellet</m> barely scatters and makes
a big hole in porte-corps armor or others.</ab>

         <head>Loading an arquebus</head>

         <ab>You must have different charges depending to the range that you want
your arquebus to have, all of which have a screw on the end that fits in
the nut of the the said arquebus' ramrod. So when you put the powder in
the charge, which is in the nut, hold the ramrod upright. And raising
your arquebus up, insert the said ramrod until the charge is in the
bottom of the arquebus, then straighten the arquebus, the mouth of the
barrel up, and remove the ramrod. That way, your powder will now be
entirely in the breech without any grain or dust that lines the sides of
the arquebus, which always has some grime in the chamber. That way it
will not recoil, and you will shoot more true.</ab>

latten</m> &amp; one <ms>part</ms> of <m>basin latten</m>. And among
basins, the <m>latten</m> of larger ones is more brittle than that of
skillets, because in order to make the round shape so small it is
necessary that the substance be softer. For big ones, that have a more
ample round shape, the substance can be more brittle. In any event, the

must be cast very <del>neat</del> hot. <del>One</del> When one wants to
cast, one casts <m>lead</m> into the substance, which makes it flow

         <ab>They become brittle having been put back to melt, often or for a

melts a <fr>saulmon</fr>, the <m>tin</m> thickens at the bottom if,
while casting, one does not stir it often. It is best for casting to

<del>
               <fr>remuer</fr>

renders them breakable. The <m>looking glass tin</m> whitens them.
<del>One</del> 
            <pro>Pewterers</pro> put in <del>on the <m>fine

<ms>quintal</ms> of <m>fine tin</m> &amp; two <ms>lb</ms> &amp; a half
or three <ms>lb</ms> of <m>red &amp; soft copper of cauldrons</m>, which
is better than <m>latten.</m> There is <m>fine &amp; soft tin</m> &amp;
<m>brittle tin</m>. The brittle one is cast in <tl>
               <fr>grille</fr>

by the <pro>pewterers</pro> to sell it better. <del>
               <fr>O</fr>

They come out better &amp; more neatly in <tl>
               <m>stone</m> moulds</tl>
than in a <tl>
               <m>copper</m> mold</tl>, because <m>copper</m> is fat
&amp; sticks unless one heats the <tl>mold</tl> well or one casts large
works. Three <ms>quarters</ms> of <m>lead</m> per one <ms>lb</ms> of
<m>soft tin</m>, makes a very liquid line &amp; proper for casting,
which has a shine like a mirror. <m>Tallow for glass</m> lightens them.
All things that lightens well <m>metals</m> &amp; remove their thickness
&amp; dense nature &amp; render them <del>like</del> liquid like
<m>water</m>, render them proper for casting, for it is the thickness
that prevents them from running. <m>Soft tin</m> is more even
<del>
               <fr>com</fr>
            </del> than the <m>brittle one</m>, which is whiter and
seems to be burnished like a mirror.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-bottom</margin>
To alloy well <m>tin</m> &amp; <m>lead</m>, one needs to melt one by
itself, and then mix in the other, small pieces at a time, and throw it
often on the <tl>
               <m>marble</m>
            </tl> or the <tl>
               <m>square tile</m>
            </tl>.
And when you will see it become well even <del>like</del> &amp; shiny as
if it were burnished, it is good. Because sometimes it becomes spotted
due to too much <m>lead</m> &amp; sometimes due to too much <m>tin</m>.
There is some <m>tin</m> that has more <m>lead</m> than others.
<m>Common tin</m> is the one that is mixed with <m>lead</m>.</ab>

&amp; to make sure that the side with the traced line is stuck to the

handkerchief</m> the back of the <m>paper</m> which, by rubbing, will
become so delicate that almost only the line will remain, which, next,
one follows in cutting the surface. You could do this with historiated

         <head>The Work done in Algiers</head>

         <ab>Have a <al>colt</al> of three of four years and feed it on
<del>
               <m>rye</m>
            </del> 
            <m>barley</m> and <m>straw</m> cut in the same way
as that which they use to feed horses in <pl>Spain</pl>. Let it drink
<m>water</m> from a good fountain or river <sup>
               <m>water</m>
            </sup>. I do
not know if it would be good sometimes to let him drink the <m>water</m>
of <m>sulfur</m> springs, and to sometimes give him <m>fenugreek</m> or
other hot foods, for the intention of the <pro>worker</pro> is to use
the heat of his <m>manure</m>, and the climate here is cooler than that
of Algiers. Keep it in a warm place and use it and make sure it loses
none of its <m>manure</m> or <m>urine</m>, of which you will make a mass
or two so that while one cools the other will keep its heat and be
suitable to continue. Also have a large flask as thick as possible, one
finger thick if it can be so made, and with a capacity of one pitcher or
<m>clay</m> jug, and around the feast of St John place a dozen and a
half <m>chicken eggs</m>, that is to say, the <m>egg</m> without the
<m>
               <sup>egg</sup> white</m> and the <m>germ</m>. Others say sixty
<m>yolks</m>. And with this dozen and a half of <m>chicken egg yolks</m>
put one half ounce (others say sixty <m>eggs</m> and a half pound) of
<m>female silk worm eggs</m>. And after carefully luting the flask (I do
not know if air will be needed for the generation) and bury it in the
heat of the <m>manure</m> up to the neck, and leave it there until
several <al>worms</al> are engendered and then remove the flask and do
not bury it in the <m>manure</m> anymore. But put it on the hot layer of
the <m>manure</m> until all the <al>worms</al> are eaten and consume one
another by shriveling and stirring, and only one remains. Once this has
happened, you must lure it at regular intervals, day and night, with the
assistance of two men, who will care for it in shifts, and you will lure
it with an <m>egg yolk</m> covered in <m>gold</m> leaf or with a liquid
<m>yolk</m> into which the <m>gold</m> leaf has been incorporated. And
be careful that it does not miss such fodder (some say one <m>egg
yolk</m> per hour, others say three, but the thing itself will
demonstrate the practice). So nourished in this way it will grow in two

that everything is cold again. Because the exaltation may be dangerous.
And for that moment, when you take it with some tongs, do cover your
mouth with some good <m>vinegar</m> and have a protection and cover
yourself with it. Once it has died out, put it into a cloth or a canvas
made of <m>silk</m> and fold it and hold it to a board exposed to air
and the sun will dry it. Once it is well dry, powder it in a mortar and
keep this powder cautiously Because one ounce of this one thrown on 3
pounds of melted <m>♁</m> transforms it into a finer <m>☉</m> than the
other one. But there is not so much pitch. You also have to choose the
oldest <m>♁</m> possible which has often melted before and finely
hammered into blades or other works, and at first purify it by melting
and throwing it into some <m>honey</m> and <m>vinegar</m>. The
completion time for such work is nine months from Saint John's day until
the 25th April. </ab>

         <ab>They are produced from seed, that is to say eggs, that which is sold
by the <ms>ounce</ms>, which is commonly sold in <pl>Languedoc</pl> iii
<ms>lb</ms> v <cn>s</cn>. The one from <pl>Spain</pl> that
<pro>merchants</pro> bring there is considered the best because the
<al>worms</al> which come from there are not so subject to illnesses
&amp; make more <m>silk</m>. In <pl>Spain</pl>, one <ms>ounce</ms> of
<del>
               <m>silk</m>
            </del> seed, they produce there <al>worms</al> which
commonly yield <del>
               <fr>ord</fr>
            </del> xv <ms>lb</ms> of <m>silk</m>.
But <del>

               </fr>
            </del> from one <ms>ounce</ms> of seed
produced in <pl>France</pl>, they only return x or xii. Three
<ms>ounces</ms> of seed are for producing such a quantity of
<al>worms</al>, that with them you will be able to furnish a <env>room
accomodated with three or 4 shelves of large shelves</env>. Willingly
they begin to unskin themselves <tmp>around holy week</tmp>. And for
doing this, one puts them in a <tl>
               <pa>fir</pa> box</tl>, like those
where one puts <fr>dragée</fr>, warmly among <tl>feather cushions</tl>.
And at the beginning, they unskin themselves like <del>
               <fr>f</fr>
            </del>
little <pl>black ants</pl>, &amp; as soon as there are two or three
unskinned, one needs to give them <m>
               <pa>white mulberry</pa> leaves</m>,
and then arrange them on the <tl>shelves</tl>. And three <ms>times
<tmp>per day</tmp>
            </ms>, one needs to exchange <m>fresh leaves</m>. And
if <tmp>during the day</tmp> there is some <env>thunder <add>or rainy
weather, cloud-covered &amp; cool</add>
            </env>, one needs to keep in the
<env>room</env> three or 4 <tl>chafing dishes <del>&amp;</del> with
glowing charcoal</tl>, &amp; put in <m>incense</m> until all the
<env>room</env> would be filled with <m>smoke</m>. And when the
<env>weather is warm &amp;<fr>serain</fr>
            </env>, the <m>silk</m> abounds
more &amp; and then it is better. Some <al>worms</al> make it whiter,
others more yellowish. And even if it may be white, it yellows when one
draws it through <tl>
               <m>hot water</m>

            <del>
               <fr>despuys</fr>
            </del>.
The <al>worms</al>, <tmp>from their birth until the <del>their</del>
time when they make their cocoons &amp; their prisons</tmp>, sleep &amp;
rest 4 times, &amp; each time remain 4 or five <ms>
               <tmp>days</tmp>
            </ms>
resting without eating, as if they were dying for rebirth another time,
for each time they change skin &amp; begin by unskinning the head then
consequently, on different <tmp>days</tmp>, the <del>
               <fr>s</fr>
            </del>
rest of the body, &amp; from white turn grayish, &amp; from grayish to
white <del>
               <fr>en fin</fr>
            </del>. And if one of them has some illness
who does not have the strength to unskin, one needs to help it &amp;
prevent puncturing it, for at that time rendering a yellow liquor, it is
no longer worth anything. And further they scarcely profit after one has
handled it with the <tl>
               <bp>hand</bp>
            </tl>. <tmp>Around Pentecost</tmp>,

            </del> lengthen &amp; raise the head &amp; a part of
the body. At that time one carries them to the <pa>heather</pa> branches
where they stop &amp; begin to spin their prison, which one calls
cocoon, commonly the <ms>size of a <al>pigeon</al> egg</ms>, although
one finds many much bigger because it sometimes happens that two or

coming out it <ms>shorter by half</ms> &amp; only has 4 feet. On the
other hand, it has become a <al>butterfly</al> &amp; has wings, without
flying however. And there are male &amp; female. As soon as they come
out of the cocoon, the male charges the female &amp; one puts them on a
<tl>white linen</tl>, where they make their eggs. Which female would not
be good &amp; profitable if the male was not given to her. And when the
male has detached himself from a female, one needs to throw it, for it
would not be good to give it to another. They have completed spinning
&amp; making their eggs in three <ms>

because when washing the <tl>
               <fr>pinceau</fr>
            </tl> for <m>distemper</m>,
one always leaves it moist. And on the contrary, when one cleans the

               <fr>pinceau</fr>
            </tl> in <m>oil</m> to soften, one wipes the

            <m>Lake</m> takes long to dry in <m>oil</m> and for that reason one must
grind <m>glass</m> in it. But one needs to choose <m>crystallin</m>
because it is neater. And because it would be too difficult to grind by
itself, one must redden it on the fire, then when entirely red throw it
into cold <m>water</m>, &amp; it will be crumbled &amp; pulverized
easily for grinding after. Being well ground <del>it</del> with a lot of
<m>water</m>, it resembles ground <m>lead white</m>, but for this it has

         <ab>For taking the fattiness from <tl>
               <m>marbles</m>
            </tl>, one grinds
<m>ordinary ashes</m> on it, which is good afterward to make the first
primer coat of a panel that is prepared in <m>oil</m> in order to seal
the cracks &amp; chinks of the <m>wood</m>. It has more body than
<m>chalk</m> &amp; it has <del>
               <m>chalk</m>
            </del> a certain fattiness.

<del>On</del> Once this primer coat is made on the <m>wood</m>, one
scrapes with a <tl>knife</tl> to even it. Next one makes a second coat
of <m>ceruse</m> or of the <add>poorest</add> colors mixed together. In

working, which they are very careful about. In this way their work
appears very soft, especially in small work, in which one needs to apply
more diligence because one looks at them more closely. They
<corr>usually</corr> finish the forehead, then the eyes, next the nose,

shadow, like the side of the forehead, &amp; the cheek, &amp; the area

they put their shadows separately, which they do not make as dark as
they could not naturally be. In sum, they do not put shadow on flesh

         <ab>One needs too choose the most <del>beautiful</del> delicate that
will be possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work with it in
<m>oil</m>. And if you do not find any that is subtle enough, you can
grind it well, not with <m>water</m> but with <m>oil</m>, &amp; grind it
thickly. Next lay it on your <tl>palette</tl> &amp; mix in a little
<m>turpentine</m>, but not much, to give it a bond, and make it to be as
thick as <m>butter</m> or <m>mortar</m>, &amp; then, with a <tl>fairly
large <fr>pinceau</fr>
            </tl>, work it by always moving the
<tl>
               <fr>pinceau</fr>
            </tl> back and forth. Then, to soften it, hatch
across it in a jagged manner with <del>the</del> the <tl>tip of the
<fr>pinceau</fr>
            </tl>. The highlights will be made with

            </del> the same thinned <corr>with</corr> 
            <m>ceruse</m>,
which, giving it a bond, makes it easier to work. I have seen it used
thus. It must be very thick, &amp; such that you all but struggle to
spread it with your <tl>
               <fr>pinceau</fr>
            </tl>. And it is all the better
if you lay down your panel. All these difficulties do not arise when it
is very subtle &amp; thin without being ground, and does not run.</ab>

         <ab>After you have primed your panel &amp; scraped with a <tl>knife</tl>
to render it quite even, you will start drawing with the longest piece
of <tl>
               <m>charcoal</m>
            </tl> you can find, for with a short one you would
not see your line so well &amp; would do it more roughly. Let the tip of
the <tl>
               <m>charcoal</m>
            </tl> be thin, &amp; in order not to render it
dull &amp; blunt soon, drag the tip flat, thus you will constantly
sharpen it. Also, hold your <tl>
               <m>charcoal</m>
            </tl> as far at the end
as you can, <del>&amp; do it</del> &amp; accustom yourself
<del>
               <fr>af</fr>
            </del> make a light line. For if you accustom yourself
to drawing delicately with <tl>
               <m>charcoal</m>
            </tl>, you will do
likewise with colors. And he who is rough with <tl>
               <m>charcoal</m>
            </tl>
is never excellent with colors. And by a line of <m>charcoal</m>,
<pro>masters</pro> pass judgement on their <pro>apprentices</pro>. First
make the outline of your drawing, that is the contour, lightly &amp;
without any too scrupulous work, but boldly. In so doing, you will teach
yourself to be an <pro>artist</pro>, and if you need to to undo
anything, you will not waste as much time as if you had elaborated it.
Next re-work all the distinctive lines, &amp; do not keep too close to
your panel, but occasionally step away from it to better judge the
proportions. Once the first drawing seems good to you, retrace all the
lines with the <tl>
               <fr>pinceau</fr>
            </tl> in rose color or another color
in <m>gum</m> or <m>distemper</m>. Thus you will work more confidently
with colors, and with less <add>effort</add>.</ab>

         <ab>Never put down, if you can, two colors one on top of the other. But
after you have made your design carefully, keep the space for shadows
alone by themselves &amp; for the lights &amp; highlights individually
as well, without layering a color all across &amp; then highlighting or
shading on it. And in this way, you further your work, economise your
colours &amp; work neatly, which is the reason that, the colors not
being muddled nor mixed together, they do not die &amp; you soften the
colors better, since they are not so thick.</ab>

         <head>Shadows</head>

         <ab> Because blacks make in different colors, some a reddish black,
others tend towards blue, and others towards green, choose those which
tend towards yellow to make beautiful shadows in <m>oil</m>, for shadow,
especially that of men, is yellowish. And for this effect use very
strongly ground <m>jet</m>, which you will mix with a little
<m>
               <add>yellow</add> ochre</m> &amp; <m>lead white</m>. Or else, after

            </figure>, grind the <m>jet</m> into it. Thus it will be more
desiccative, &amp; making on its own a yellowish black. A little white
mixed in renders it perfect for men's shadows. Blacks which make a
greenish black are appropriate for women's shadows. Take, then, some
black of <gap/>, a little <m>sap-green</m> &amp; <m>bistre</m>, &amp;

         <ab>The <pl>Flemish</pl> &amp; those who paint panels by the dozen only
make one layer &amp; finish at the first go. But the colors soon die.

         <ab>Because it is very tedious to paint in <m>distemper</m> on

         <head>Colors in <m>oil</m> that are imbibed</head>

         <ab>It is best that colors in <m>oil</m> are imbibed, that is to say
they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if
in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the
<m>oil</m> has remained in that part which would make the colors die.
The <m>varnish</m> mends all this &amp; unites &amp; renders it similar
in one place as in another.</ab>

         <ab>One needs gold color to be laid down thick, for if it is clear, it
would be imbibed &amp; would run.</ab>

because the three aforesaid colors are gripping &amp; dry immediately.
Next they lay down the <m>gold</m>, then varnish on top of all. And it

         <ab>I have tried four kinds of sand for <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>:
<m>chalk</m>, <m>crushed glass</m>, <m>tripoli</m> &amp; <m>burnt
linen</m>, all four excellent. But as for the <m>chalk</m>, it needs to
be of the softest kind you can find, like <m>the <pl>Champagne</pl> one
that <pro>painters</pro> use</m>. It releases very neatly, does not need
to be moistened with <m>magistra</m> or anything else, but needs to be
completely dry, in its natural state, finely pulverized. The first cast
is always the neatest, however it will well withstand two or three. But
there is only the first one that you need to take heed of, when you want
to remake your <tl>box mold</tl> to take new <m>powdered chalk</m> that
has not yet been used for works, for the one previously used in the box
mold has dried out &amp; has no stickiness &amp; bond like the fresh
one. <m>Crushed glass</m> can be made from <m>common glass sand, however
cristallin</m> is more excellent, for <m>common glass</m> contains
<del>
               <m>glass</m>
            </del> 
            <m>salt of saltwort</m> only, but
<m>cristallin</m> contains both <m>salt of tartar</m> &amp;
<m>saltwort</m> all together, which both help fusion, the <m>glass</m>
once calcined &amp; reduced to as if to its prime substance. In order to
calcine it perfectly, throw your <m>glass</m>, lumps of whichever sort,
among the largest possible lit <m>charcoals</m> that you can, if you are
lacking some other <del>t</del>
            <add>d</add>e foeu<del>t</del> violent
heat source. And when it will be well red, throw it into
<m>water</m>.</ab>

polished work, in <m>

say the same for <m>finely pulverized tripoly</m> that does not want to

trouble than others, because it does not need to be reheated, nor
moistened, &amp; molds <add>and releases</add> very neatly <del>&amp;
very</del>, subtlety <del>&amp; releases well</del> neat, like the
previous ones &amp; withstands several castings. First you ought to burn

               <m>marble</m>

lot</del> And if you reheat it in a <tl>crucible</tl>, red hot due to
the fire, to render all of it fine &amp; impalpable, I believe it will
be even better. But because a lot of <m>linen</m> is reduced to very
little when burned, if you want to save some, you can sprinkle only the
medal that you want to mold &amp; cover it, and fill the <tl>box
mold</tl> with <m>crushed slate</m>, which molds also very neatly, but
note that the first cast is always the most beautiful &amp; the neatest.
If you cast at your convenience <m>soft tin</m> that seems to be
burnished in little wheels that <pro>pewterers</pro> sell, comes out
very neatly &amp; approaching the color of <m>silver</m>, without mixing
in anything else, it is true that one ought to cast it rather hot, &amp;
so that the molded object should be four <ms>

from the cast. In order to know its heat, first melt it well, <add>so

         <ab>The sand <env>near my area</env> is very excellent. But one ought
to, in order to make an excellent work, take it fresh, which has been
used. For it dries out after having been cast several times &amp; is
lean &amp; has no body. If you cast some fine work which has hardly any
thickness, it is necessary that your substance of <m>copper</m> be very
hot so that it penetrates &amp; runs. Some mix in <m>lead</m> with the
<fr>fonte</fr>, but it is for large works &amp; not for small ones.</ab>

         <ab>
            <m>Sand from <al>oxen</al> feet twice-burned &amp; finely ground</m>
melts more neatly with <m>copper</m>, &amp; without a <fr>chappe</fr>,
than sand that I have seen. I have cast a high relief medal with it, and
<del>
               <fr>f</fr>
            </del> with a thickness as delicate as a <tl>knife</tl>
blade or a <tl>card</tl>. And being a hollow on one side, opposite the
relief which was on other side.</ab>

         <ab>It is necessary that <m>lean sands</m> be more moistened than
others, namely with <m>magistra</m> or good <m>pure wine</m> or
<m>boiled wine with <pa>elm tree</pa> roots</m> &amp; similar things.
But <m>very fine sands</m>, like <m>burned linen</m> which is fat &amp;
soft on its own, want to be applied dry.</ab>

         <ab>All moistened sand wants to be very beaten &amp; stirred in order to
be ground finely \&amp; to flatten out the clods that it makes in itself
when it is bathed.</ab>

         <ab>The <m>
               <pa>olive</pa> oil</m> that some mix in with <m>beaten egg
white</m> makes it become porous.</ab>

         <ab>
            <m>Sand of calcined glass</m> withstands several castings, but there
are only the first ones. It also becomes porous.</ab>

         <ab>
            <m>Latten</m> comes out on its own, but it runs too quickly. It is
good to mix it with a little <m>copper</m>, like a <ms>quarter

            <m>Latten</m> is always fat, &amp; does not mold neatly. One finds

         <ab>
            <m>Copper</m> comes out well with a bit of <m>metal</m>. If you mix

         <ab>

When the <pl>English</pl> have a cold, they mull <m>wine</m> in this
manner. They heat it in a <del>large</del> 
            <tl>
               <m>tin</m> pot</tl> until
it boils, and when it is boiling up, they <del>remove it from</del>
light it with <tl>
               <m>burning paper</m>
            </tl> 
            <ms>to know if it is hot
enough</ms>. Next, to ignite it entirely, they pour it from one
<tl>vessel</tl> into another, as one who wants to beat <m>
               <fr>eau
panée</fr>
            </m>, and as they are doing this, someone else lights with a
<m>burning paper</m> what is falling from one <tl>vessel</tl> into the
other, such that you would think you were pouring fire. When the
<m>wine</m> is mulled enough, heat it again a little, adding a few
<m>cloves</m> &amp; a <ms>sufficient quantity</ms> of <m>sugar</m>. And
they <del>dri</del> drink it as hot as they can to overcome a cold.</ab>

The common <pl>English</pl> put <m>sugar</m> in the <m>wine</m> to

         </head>

         <ab>It is necessary that the <tl>box mold</tl> be well smooth &amp; that
it fits well also on the <tl>board</tl> where it sits, so that it holds
firm &amp; does not shift when one moulds. It is necessary that the sand
be clean &amp; well chosen and well reheated, &amp; pulverised very
finely on the <tl>
               <m>marble</m>
            </tl>, for the one that you want to put
first on the medal, and when molding you press strongly. Guard against
<m>oiling</m> your medal, for this would make it porous. Reheat slowly
and reheat well, &amp; let cool. Moisten your sand with <m>wine boiled
with <pa>elm</pa> root</m>, and cast <m>latten</m> which comes out well,
namely from the <m>substance of the <fr>trebuschets</fr>
            </m> and similar
thin things. Make your cast broad &amp; even if it is barely thick, it
will not be worse off, but it will enter well in the <tl>mold</tl>. Cast
from the foot of the medal, so that the face, further away from the
heat, comes out better &amp; sweetened from the violent heat. And if
your <tl>box mold</tl> does not have vents, make some
<del>
               <fr>qu</fr>
            </del> in the sand, which come, from the corners of the
piece, to render themselves into the cast. Cast very hot, something that
you will know, when you cast a little leftover substance in the one
which has already been melted, &amp; if it melts quickly, this is a sign
it is <del>
               <fr>fo</fr>
            </del> well hot. At that time, invigorate the heat
of your <tl>furnace</tl> with <tl>bellows</tl> of the right size,
keeping the mouth of the <tl>furnace</tl> well covered with some big
<del>
               <m>copper</m>
            </del> 
            <tl>
               <m>tile</m>
            </tl> or other similar thing,
which should be very red before you cast. When you want to cast, take
your well red <tl>
               <fr>mollettes</fr>
            </tl> &amp; the <tl>crooked
<m>iron</m>
            </tl> as well, to clean the <m>charcoals</m> which are in
your substance. Having cast, rub your work with a <tl>
               <m>latten</m>
wirebrush</tl>. The <m>grindings from sharpening large scissors &amp;
large knives</m> is very good for <m>copper</m>.</ab>

         <head>Casting</head>

         <ab>
            <m>Lead</m>, which is mortified &amp; weighty, wants to be cast hot,
more so than <m>tin</m>. And when it is not hot enough, it makes lines
in the medal. <del>It</del> 
            <m>Straw</m> burns in it, provided it is
hot. One can make a <m>solder</m> so soft &amp; runny that it can be
melted in a <tl>
               <m>tin</m> dish</tl>. It is composed of one
<ms>part</ms> 
            <m>looking glass tin</m>, one <ms>part</ms> 
            <m>soft
tin</m>, &amp; another <ms>part</ms> 
            <m>lead</m>. It runs very neatly
and is cast in leaves, but the work is very brittle &amp; prone to
breaking. The best <m>solder</m> is the common one for casting well, but
<del>is</del> leaves certain lumpy points. Alloy <m>lead</m> with
<m>tin</m> so that the ingot that you will cast comes out even &amp;
shiny &amp; polished, &amp; without any eyes or bubbles except for a
small point in the middle. And this sign will tell you that there is
enough <m>tin</m>, otherwise the <m>lead</m> dominates too much. Sand is
good for <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>. The good one is very thin &amp;
fine &amp; lean, which however sticks together between one’s
<tl>
               <bp>fingers</bp>
            </tl>. The sand wants to be reheated before being
put to work. And <del>once</del> to mold <add>with it</add>, it wants to
be very moistened &amp; then reheated, not all at once nor with a burst
of fire, for this corrupts &amp; makes it shrink &amp; crumble as well.
But if you reheat it gently, it renders itself very stiff, once well
moistened. One ought to pass it through a <tl>shirt
<add>sleeve</add>
            </tl> for the finest one, in order to first put some on
the piece to mold.</ab>

         <ab>One makes a <m>solder</m> with <m>quicksilver</m>
            <del>but</del>which is white, but it is brittle. Make your <tl>box
mold</tl> so that it joins well &amp; that one does not see the daylight
between the joints.</ab>

         <ab>The <pl>Germans</pl> cast their <m>leads</m> very thinly, rather
than very thickly, because it seems they come out better, but so that
are not too pliant, being so thin, they mix a little <m>tin</m> with the
said <m>lead</m>, which otherwise would fold up like <m>wax</m>.</ab>

         <ab>The blackest <m>lead</m>, so say some, is the best &amp; the softest
&amp; which runs the best. <sn>You will know its goodness by rubbing it
with your <tl>
                  <bp>finger</bp>
               </tl>, which will render it very black
quickly</sn>. </ab>

         <ab>The alloy good for running <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> is per one
<ms>lb</ms> of <m>lead</m>, one <ms>lb</ms> &amp; a half of <m>tin</m>
            <del>
               <fr>aultr</fr>
            </del>, so that the tin exceeds more than one
<ms>part</ms>. It is <m>solder</m> which flows well &amp; that is good
for casting, but it is brittle.</ab>

         <ab>

            <margin>right-top</margin>

            </tl> molds <m>lead</m> better than
anything else. But try it to see if it needs reheating. <del>One ought
to mold on the back of the <m>bones</m> &amp; from this side for the
<m>marrow</m> is more delicate there.</del>
         </ab>

         <ab>

            <margin>left-middle</margin>

The <m>bone marrow</m> towards the tail is more delicate &amp; does have
not as many stripes &amp; molds more cleanly. The <m>shell</m> which
holds the <m>marrow</m>, once calcined, is good for making sand.</ab>

         <ab>

When you cast <m>lead</m>, one ought to cast it <del>cast very
neatly</del>

<tl>box mold</tl> a little &amp; cast two or three times. However, if it
is cast too hot, it will rise up &amp; swell. When it is very hot, it
becomes blue, let it then pass this color <del>

rest a little before casting.</ab>

         <ab>If you wish to raise <m>water</m> higher than its source, make a
pipe descend as in A. to B. to give it push <del/>, then from B. to C.
make the pipe ascend, but not quite to the height of the source, here
represented by the dotted line, and then make it descend again in a pipe
from C. to D., and then let it rise higher than the line demarcating the
height of the source, and do this successively until you reach the
desired height. Remark nonetheless that the length of the descending
pipe is always twice as long as the ascending pipe. This cone also fills
itself and demonstrates a perpetual fountain which you can adapt into a
rock, attracting the water with which it is filled by the tip here
marked, by sucking and breathing in. You can also make a watering can
pipe in this way, so long as the bent pipe is just as long as the
straight pipe, but does not extend as far down.</ab>

         <ab>They usually cast with <m>solder</m>, even the things that should

it, just like they put in a little of it in <m>soft tin</m>. They carve
their works on <m>stones of which are made the sharpening stones or
files of <pro>barbers</pro>
            </m>, which are found in <env>great flakes
towards the mountains</env>, &amp; resemble <m>slate</m>. They are three

<del>
               <fr>dard</fr>
            </del> of the color of dark <m>slate</m>, the other
whitish. When they have some relief, first they imprint it on

            </ms>, <add>to serve as a pattern</add>, then with a
little <tl>compass</tl> &amp; little matching <m>iron fittings</m>, they
carve their figures, having first flattened their <m>stones</m> &amp;
worn down one against the other, they make their <del>
               <fr>p</fr>
            </del>
molds of three or four pieces, to make a circle or a square which joins
perfectly, because the <m>stones</m> render themselves even. Before
casting, they rub the mould with <m>tallow</m>, which has quickly
absorbed it because it is hot. Then, taking <m>fine powder of
quicklime</m> in a <tl>
               <m>linen</m>
            </tl>, they rub the mould while
beating with the <tl>
               <m>linen</m>
            </tl> on top, then blow a little on top
to prevent it from becoming porous. The main thing is to make vents. If
the work is big and they make it in such a way as seen here, they pierce
a hole in the part of the medal, that is least visible. And with a
<tl>gimblet</tl> they pierce the mold on the side of the medal.

ought to be beat hard so that it does not crack. If the piece is very

wide or too deep because the narrower, the better. For when it is big,
the weight of the substance that runs breaks &amp; shakes loose the

distances as small as those of the small wheels. But they make a
“<fr>platte forme</fr>” (as they call it) out of <m>latten</m> 
            <sup>that
has been</sup> divided into various circles, &amp; each <sup>of
those</sup> circle<sup>s</sup> is divided into equal sections marked by
a point. And each circle has a certain number <sup>of points</sup>, as
<sup>for example</sup> one <sup>has</sup> 30, another 36, others 40
&amp;. Then, on the pierced center of the platform, they place the
little wheel. And on the center of the wheel <sup>there is</sup> a flat
line or an alidade which points to the number on the circle that you
want to mark on your wheel. Then with a point, they draw a line on the
wheel. Then they return the alidade to the following point, &amp; they
thus go on marking it <sup>the dial</sup>. And to mark the points on the
circles of their platform, they divide the circle in three &amp; then
divide this third part into as many sections as is necessary with regard
to the total division of the circle. &amp;, in this manner, they make
the teeth's division &amp; distribution as fine as they please.</ab>

            </del>, which is
the most brittle, molds more neatly, according to the opinion of many
people, than <m>fine latten of skillets</m>, just like all <m>fine
latten</m> molds neater than <m>red copper</m>. If you want to cast
something fine &amp; thin, the entire secret is to cast as hot as
possible so that the substance boils. You will recognize that it is hot
enough when it smokes a lot and while stirring it throws sparks. To heat
well, place your <tl>crucible</tl> as low as possible &amp; at the very
bottom of the <tl>forge</tl>, so that the <tl>bellows</tl>
            <del>
               <fr>fra</fr>
            </del> beat on the middle of the <tl>crucible</tl>, for
in this way it is better than on the <tl>grill</tl> on which one usually
puts the <tl>crucible</tl>, under which the <tl>bellows</tl> beat. It is
true that the <tl>crucible</tl> risks more danger breaking, but you can
<m>lute</m> it as you know <pro>founders</pro> do. And also, one ought
to maintain the <m>charcoal</m> between the <tl>bellows</tl> &amp; the
<tl>crucible</tl>. Also take heed to cast all at once &amp; not in
increments &amp; drop by drop, which would stop &amp; plug up the
conduit of the substance. And if make in the cast an <fr>abreveoir</fr>
to <fr>abreuver</fr> the medal, it would be even better. And so that the
substance heats well at the bottom, stir it, once melted, with a
<tl>
               <m>wood</m> stick</tl>, for <m>iron</m> only makes it brittle.

Dissolve in <env>damp place</env> some <m>tallow of glass</m>, and then

Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other.</head>

         <ab>

It is necessary to cast two pieces of <m>copper</m>, <m>latten</m> or
similar <m>metal</m>, very neatly, and then when you have molded the
cavity in the sand, leave the figure of <m>metal</m> that
<corr>you</corr> have molded in the <tl>frame</tl>, without moving it
from its place. And cast, &amp; if there is not enough thickness press a
little &amp; push the figure down in the <tl>frame</tl>.</ab>

         <ab>

It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but
with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at
the entry of the medal, &amp; there, where the force is, the
<m>filth</m> &amp; <m>grime</m> accumulate. And, in this way, if you
were mold the face towards the cast, some <m>grime</m> could be found
there, &amp; it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier
to repair.</ab>

         <ab>

            <m>Vinegar</m> is better for moistening than <m>wine</m>. It is
necessary that the <tl>frame</tl> be well smooth and even, otherwise
<del>and that the cast be</del>, as you press on one side, the other one
lifts.</ab>

         <ab>

This is why the <tl>press</tl> is better, for it tightens evenly, &amp;
more than your <tl>
               <bp>hands</bp>
            </tl>, and makes

the <m>lumpy sand</m>, which is damp, communicate its humidity to the
<m>soft &amp; fine sand</m>, which is sprinkled &amp; <fr>poncé</fr> dry
on the medal.</ab>

         <ab>

When you mold, always leave your medal in <del>one of</del>
            <add>the</add> 
            <tl>frames</tl>, <del>is</del> 
            <add>without stirring
it</add> because, if your cavity is not molded very neatly, you can put
it back in the right place by means of <tl>pegs</tl>, which will prevent
it from shifting. But, at first, <fr>ponce</fr> yout medal with very
fine <m>
               <pa>willow</pa> charcoal</m>, &amp; <del>
               <fr>se</fr>
            </del> next
clean it, for this degreases it, &amp; makes it easier to release.</ab>

         <ab>Do not knock it when molding because this will shake loose the

let it do in order to reduce it to powder, &amp; molding it with sand,

            </tl> &amp; the sharp edge of

               <m>linen</m>
            </tl>
over it, so that it does not remain too <m>oiled</m>, and I noted that,
in this way, it would come out better in release, because the
<m>ceruse</m>, once moistened with <m>water of egg glair</m>, would not
attach to the <m>oil</m>. This worked very well and I molded a medal of
high relief very neatly, without making any stickiness, which a lot of
good sands, such as <m>felt</m>, <m>burnt bone</m> &amp; <m>iron
dross</m>, had failed to do on the first try. I reheated it &amp; my
<tl>mold</tl> became hard like <m>marble</m>, and I realized with this,
that sands for molding high relief should be well moistened with some
<m>water</m>, which gives them body &amp; compactness, like <m>egg
glair</m>, <m>gummed water</m>, <del>

withstands as many castings as you wish, for it is as hard as

         <ab>Since then I have realized that this sand, even though it is
excellent &amp; endures many castings &amp; molds very neatly, it is
however fat and makes things porous. This, <m>soft lead</m> 
            <del>and
the</del> does not come out so well. But try to mix it with a <m>lean
sand</m>, such as <m>pumice</m>, <m>flakes</m>, &amp; similar things, to

<tl>frame</tl>, now with the flame of my <tl>furnace</tl>, now putting
lit <m>charcoals</m> on top of it, that it became almost red. I let it
cool and cast. It came out very neatly in relief on one side &amp; in

that the material was whitish, as almost metallic, but this was because
of the <m>

<del>
               <fr>les</fr>

            </tl>, and in this way, I molded neatly with a good
release. And even though it seemed to me that the <m>pulverised bone</m>
was lumpy, if there is some <m>substance of skillet</m> thrown in, my
figures came out very neatly. It is true that I had very very reheated
my <tl>frame</tl>, it withstood only one cast. <rub>I find</rub> that
when a sand is so finely grounded that it renders itself dense as
<m>ceruse</m> &amp; even, <del>like</del> without knowing it to be arid,
rarefied, <m>
               <fr>areneux</fr>
            </m> &amp; rather spongy, that it molds
very neatly, but it does not receive <m>metal</m> so well, as if it were
porous to absorb the substance. But rather, once fat &amp; even, it
becomes porous &amp; does not receive fine lines. <rub>I believe that
the secret</rub> to cast well lies in finding a sand that receives the
<m>metal</m> well, one for <m>lead</m>, the other for another, for each
one has its particular one. Let it be molded slowly &amp; scrupulously,
and leave it for a few days to become compact by itself, if you have the
time for this. And next, reheat it very well not all at once nor over
with a large fire, but little by little, otherwise it crumbles &amp;
always has some fault. Finally, you ought to cast the <m>copper</m> or
<m>latten</m> or other <m>great metals</m> very hot, &amp; if it
possible in large quantities of substance, which contain more heat than
small quantities. It is necessary that the <tl>frame</tl> be cold, &amp;
that you cast all at once. Always <m>lute</m> the entrance of your

         <ab>In order to mold well, one ought in a big <tl>frame</tl> several
medals together, for when there is a lot of substance, &amp; the
<tl>crucible</tl> is almost full, it heats more, &amp; then, if one
medal does not come out well, the other will be good.</ab>

         <ab>It is better to melt in a <tl>bellows furnace</tl> than in a
<tl>
               <fr>four à vent</fr>
            </tl>, because it gives a more vigorous heat. It
is true that <m>latten</m> melts well in the <tl>
               <fr>four à
vent</fr>
            </tl>, because it is easier to melt than <m>copper</m>, being
more brittle.</ab>

         <ab>
            <rub>Some of the <pro>founders</pro>
            </rub> have this superstition,
that only <tmp>three days a week</tmp> are good for melting, namely
<tmp>Tuesdays</tmp>, <del>
               <tmp>Wednesdays</tmp>
            </del>
            <tmp>Thursdays</tmp>, and <tmp>Saturdays</tmp>. The others, for them,
are unlucky.</ab>

         <ab>When you mold, do not knock excessively on the medal, which is in
the sand, because it prevents it from releasing very neatly, &amp;
shakes loose the <tl>mold</tl>.</ab>

         <ab>Take heed also that the sand does not surpass the edges of the
<tl>frame</tl>, for it makes the molded medal higher than the cast,
&amp; in this way, <m>metal</m> will never enter the mold. Therefore,
always make sure that the surface of your casted object directly lines
up with the <tl>mold</tl>, and to make this effect, if you wish, put a
lump of <tl>
               <m>
                  <fr>carton</fr>
               </m>

wish.</ab>

               <pro>Founders</pro>

works from becoming porous, are careful to well reheat their molds. And
to know if they have been reheated enough, they knock against it with
their <tl>
               <bp>finger</bp>
            </tl>, &amp; if they <sn>ring</sn> like a pot,
then they are.</ab>

         <ab>Very burnt sand loses its bond. <m>Slate</m> is reheated &amp; molds
neatly. Next, it is true that often it becomes porous, like <m>burned

I find that one ought not to knowck on very finely ground sands, for it
shakes them loose, &amp; <del>make</del> prevents them from releasing

         </head>

         <ab> Casting sand coming from the <env>mine</env>, once passed through a
<tl>double sieve</tl>, next put in with <m>melted resin</m>, burns &amp;
inflames &amp; becomes all red &amp; inflamed like <m>iron</m>. Once
cold it is completely black and can be ground very finely on
<tl>
               <m>porphyry</m>
            </tl>. Thus having prepared it &amp; render it
without asperity on the <tl>
               <bp>fingernail</bp>
            </tl>, I moistened it
with <m>beaten egg glair</m> &amp; beat it well, until it was not pasty
but rather powdery. I found it of very good release, &amp; molded with
it in <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> very neatly, but it wants to be well
reheated &amp; at ease.</ab>

         <ab>Others beat it well in a <tl>mortar</tl>, in small amounts at a
time, &amp; thus it detaches and renders very finely. Then they reheat
it moderately, only to dry it. Then they grind it dry on
<tl>
               <m>porphyry</m>
            </tl>. And thus it becomes as if impalpable, and not
too dried out, <del>it</del> and it retains body &amp; bond of the
<m>earth</m> of which it is related, and is better than when it is very
burnt. Once moistened with <m>egg glair wiped with a
<tl>sponge</tl>
            </m>, it releases <del>very neatly <fr>M</fr>
            </del> very
neatly in low relief, but not for figures in high relief. Therefore,
since then I experimented <del>
               <fr>lexper</fr>
            </del> with moistening it
only with very strong <m>vinegar</m>. It released a figure which I could
not release previously. And I believe that, moistening the finest in the
same way like with <m>glair</m> &amp; the lumpiest, to fill the
<fr>chasses</fr> with <m>salt water</m> or <m>wine</m>, that they do not
ally so well. Since they are of the same nature &amp; are moistened the
same, they embrace each other, &amp; hold together one with the
other.</ab>

            <rub>To mold well</rub>, after having prepared your sands, mold <tmp>in

on another.

</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-middle</margin>
One ought to choose the one which is usually <del>as</del> in clods
&amp; lumps, well <env>deep in the earth</env>, for usually the one that
is found <env>above</env> has too much <m>earth</m>, and the deep one is
similar to <m>rock</m>.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-middle</margin>
I have molded with it in <m>pure lead</m> very <del>neatly</del> hot,
&amp; I had as an example the first very neat one, but the
<m>vinegar</m> hardly gives it any bond, &amp; thus it withstood only
one cast. </ab>

attaching itself &amp; being pasted to your <tl>

            </tl>. You
will with it mold very neatly. But let it dry &amp; reheat really well,
leaving the <tl>mold</tl> inside, so that it acquires strength by
reheating, for it becomes hard as <m>stone</m>, &amp; and in this way is
more certain to release well. Otherwise if you release before having
reheated it, there would be danger of it crumbling in some place,
because of its delicateness &amp; fineness, even if the medal of high
relief. Once you have molded with it, pulverize it as before and put it
back <env>in dampness</env>.</ab>

         <ab>There is found in <pl>Cominge</pl>, near the <env>town</env> of

<tl>
               <m>porphyry</m>
            </tl> &amp; is easy to crush. And once crushed, it
resembles <m>calcined alabaster</m>. It molds very neatly, and I have
not found any that molds as delicately as this one for low relief. It is
excellent to mold en <fr>noyau</fr> without a frame, having crushed it
impalpable with <m>gummed or pure water</m> on <tl>
               <m>porphyry</m>
            </tl>,
then placing it, thick as <m>mustard</m> or a little more, on the medal,
smeared with a <m>oil either <pa>olive</pa>, <pa>walnut</pa>, even
better <pa>spike lavender</pa>
            </m>. But to do it better
<del>
               <fr>mo</fr>
            </del>, let it dry by itself, without fire, for one or
two <ms>
               <tmp>days</tmp>
            </ms>. Although, if you are in a hurry, you can
heat it well, &amp; it will not crack, if it is not put on too lightly.
It is true, being thus suddenly exposed to heat all at once, it makes
some holes &amp; bubbles, which it does not do when dried in the cold or
at ease, rather than being reheated. Once dry, reheat it &amp; it will
withstand several casts. </ab>

         <ab>Every tree that has coarser marrow, <add>the graft</add> is awkward
to <del>
               <fr>estre</fr>
            </del> cut <add>well</add>, because there is a
danger of wounding the marrow, &amp; if it is wounded at the point of
juncture, it takes uneasily, like from the <pa>vine</pa>, from all
<pa>peaches</pa> &amp; <pa>apricots</pa>.</ab>

         <ab>
            <pa>Apricot trees</pa> have a very thin bark, &amp; thus one needs
to graft them onto young trees which do not yet have thick
<sup>bark</sup>, like on shoots of <pa>prune trees</pa> &amp; <pa>almond
trees</pa>.</ab>

         <ab>The grafts scarcely <del>
               <ill/>
            </del> take if the cut of the tree is
dampened. One needs then to graft in <env>
               <fr>serain</fr> &amp; mild
weather, &amp; not too cold &amp; windy</env>.</ab>

         <ab>Old wood that one leaves to graft is necessary if one grafts on a
tree that is already made &amp; of good size, because being such, it
tightens the graft more, &amp; if it is from young wood, it is so
compressed that it cannot profit. But old wood resists the compression
of old wood <del>than the young</del> better, because it is harder than
the young. But if the graft is all of old wood, it will never hold
beautifully, but turns fragile &amp; short &amp; slow to
grow.</ab>

time before replacing the piece, <fr>ponce</fr> with some
<m>
               <pa>willow</pa> charcoal</m>, for it makes it release well. When you

                  <al>cuttlefish</al> bone</m>
            </tl>. When you have cast, leave it

something you will know when the <tl>

the <tl>

&amp; <m>tin</m> is as much one as the other. If the piece is difficult
to come out, &amp; of several pieces, make the cast forked with three or
four grooves, <del>and make</del> &amp; direct these grooves to the
place of thickest parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like
directly on the head, for this attracts the <m>metal</m> &amp; absorbs
the figure best. Shake your <tl>frame</tl> a little when you have cast,
and thus you will make very neatly several casts. <m>Tin</m> that is too
hot burns the <tl>
               <m>bone</m>
            </tl>, which is corrupted. Also, once taken
out <del>
               <fr>du mo</fr>

         <ab>And for this effect, one casts a medal of <m>fine tin</m>, which is
harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves
it in one half of the <tl>frame</tl>, &amp; presses it a little so that

<m>solder</m> described above, or another more meltable than <m>fine

         <ab>It is necessary that the graft not be from old wood for it is never
a beautiful tree.</ab>

         <ab>One needs to leave only two shoots at maximum on the graft, for when
it has more, its strength is weakened. The wind torments it, &amp; it
does not have enough strength for taking cuttings.</ab>

         <ab>Trees which have coarse marrow, like <pa>peach trees</pa> &amp; all
their kind &amp;the <pa>plum trees</pa>, do not want grafts <env>in
freezing weather</env> because the cold damages their marrow, which one
also needs to protect from wounding by cutting the foot of the
graft.</ab>

         <ab>All grafts must not be made earlier than their tree will be sapping,
for the <md>humor</md> grows them quickly. Otherwise
<del>
               <fr>au</fr>

         <ab>Because colors in <m>distemper</m> dry quickly &amp; one would not
have leisure to perfect the shadows &amp; touches on the face, one wets
the reverse of the face which is on <m>canvas</m> with a wet
<tl>sponge</tl>. Then, with a small <tl>
               <fr>pinceau</fr>
            </tl>, one makes
the shadows, which do not come undone. Next, one lays the flesh color,
which does not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And
again with a more lively flesh color, one touches the more prominent
areas. And with another <tl>
               <fr>pinceau</fr>
            </tl> one does the shadows
<add>again</add> by hatching. The shadow strokes do not come undone
because they are made of <m>bistre</m>, which stains the <m>canvas</m>
like <m>rust</m>. The said <m>bistre</m> is good <del>with</del> for
making shadows in <m>distemper</m> 
            <del>mix</del>, for in <m>oil</m> it
has no body &amp; would not dry but with great difficulty. One mixes in

<figure/> It is better used on <m>canvas</m>, where it is imbibed

ground in <m>oil</m>, for in this way, the beautiful shows its

         <ab>The different parts of a sword are the handle, <x>and</x> the sheath
of the sword. What comes next is the heel. The rest is the blade. The
sides are the edge and the point. Certain blades, acute in point, have
only one side filed in the middle &amp; along the whole length, and are
easy to break. Other blades are called of three molds or three grips,
which have one good rise in the middle, but this elevation is flat as if
it were acute in point but flattened. These ones are most certain.
Others are called fluted, which are notched from the middle, &amp; when
it is along the whole length, they are just as easy to break as those
acute in point and are more troublesome to burnish because the
burnishing stick can't get in. But they make one specially that is
narrow.</ab>

         <ab>Making up the hilt of the sword are the pommel, the branches of the
hilt and the cross-guard, which is this <m>iron</m> strip that closes
off the guard <x>and</x> that is at the end of the heel to stop thrusts
from sliding down the hilt. The rings are these two branches in half
round that start from the eye of the guard and go all the way to the
branch of the cross-guard. The branch that crosses the hilt is called
the body and this escutcheon, by which the sword enters the sheath and
to which all the branches return, and which holds them, is called the
eye of the guard.</ab>

         <ab>Following is the <m>wood</m> of the grip which one <m>glue</m>s or
more fittingly <x>uses</x> some <m>mingled wax</m> which is made of
<m>wax</m> and <m>pitch</m>, for <m>rosin</m> would be too hard. He
heats it lightly, then rubs the <m>wood</m> of the grip so that the tang
takes hold, or the <m>threads</m>, otherwise, when a <m>thread</m> frays
off, the whole thing will break all at once. With <m>iron</m> thread or
<m>dog skin</m>, one also uses <m>glue</m>. The trimming set on the
<m>wood</m>, which is made of <m>silk</m> or <m>thread</m>, is called
the cord, which is made from two or three <m>threads</m> twined on the
spinning wheel, or 4 if the <m>silk</m> is thin. A cord a little bigger
holds better. The rivements, which are also made of <m>silk</m> at both
ends of the grip, are called the buttons.</ab>

         <ab>Some grips are made of <m>silk</m>, <m>seal skin</m>, <m>iron</m>
thread reheated with <m>gold</m> and <m>fine</m> 
            <m>and false silver</m>
thread &amp; <m>velvet</m> 
            <x>thread</x>. <m>Iron</m> thread is of less
price and is most durable. Next is that of <m>silk</m>, if one does not
have the convenience of being close to the sea in order to recover some
<m>dog skin</m>, which is quite convenient. The good <m>skin</m> costs
fifty or lx s<exp>ous</exp> and makes 4 or five dozen grips. This one
gives a good grip and a sure hand. To put it to work, if it is too hard,
soak it for one or two hours in <m>slightly lukewarm aqua fortis</m>.
Because if it were too hot, it would boil and spoil the <m>skin</m>. It
is sewn with <m>black thread</m>.</ab>

         <ab>The <m>gold</m> handles are made with some <m>yellow thin cloth</m>
set below or other kind of <m>chalk-yellowed fabric</m>. And this
<m>cloth</m> is set on with <m>glue</m> or aforesaid <m>gum</m>. This is
in order to make the <m>thread</m> hold better on it. These latter are
made of cordons like the <m>silk</m> ones and between two cordons are
put one or two <m>threads</m> to enhance it. The <m>silver</m> one is
identically made. And there is as much difficulty as for the <m>silk</m>
one, not because <m>silk</m> is difficult to twisted, but it needs to be
twisted twice. A fine <m>gold</m> handle is worth 28 or 20 cents.</ab>

         <ab>The best sword point is of <m>sage foliage</m>.</ab>

         <ab>This long stick on which the sword is laid down and attached in

<m>rowan</m> which is hard and even.</ab>

         <ab>The stick underneath which is folded bow-like is called the
arch.</ab>

         <ab>The stick above is called stick of the fustée.</ab>

         <ab>And this square piece, used on the sword to burnish it, is called
the fustée.</ab>

         <ab>There are two horns, one is called the <m>oil</m> hornet and the
other the <m>emery</m> hornet. </ab>

         <ab>There is an <m>iron</m> tool with the shape of a halberd point,
square and made of very even and well limed <m>steel</m> called the
grateau which helps to soften lime strokes on swords hilts and to
sharpen blades once they are softened which is better than with
<m>stone</m> or other tools which leave some scratches.</ab>

         <ab>To make the swords cut better, the edge from the point is also
sharpened.</ab>

         <ab>
            <pro>Those who create sword hilts</pro> are different craftsmen than
<pro>furbishers</pro>.</ab>

         <ab>The fustée is a three-finger-thick, square <m>wood</m> tool, made of
<m>boxwood</m> which fit in the middle of the fustée stick to
furbish.</ab>

         <ab>The fresil stick is made of <m>willow wood</m> which is to <x>…</x>
weapon with some <m>clinker</m> which is the <m>iron scale</m> falling

         <ab>The <pro>furbisher</pro> buys his blades by the dozen which are not
finished, <x>but ready</x> to be pulled from <x>their</x> sheaths since
he does this himself in order to add them well at the pommels and
guards.</ab>

         <ab>Spanish swords are esteemed to be better for they are of better
<m>steel</m> and <m>iron</m> but they are not as well-forged as swords
from Vienne in Dauphiné. The Spanish ones are not as well sharpened from
the forge since they sharpen them with their feet and this is what makes
them wavy.</ab>

         <ab>Blades from Vienne commonly cost xviii or 19 lb.</ab>

         <ab>The first thing the <pro>furbisher</pro> does to his new blades is
to draw them out from the sheath, which he does himself or has it done
by <pro>locksmiths</pro> or <pro>blacksmiths</pro> to whom he gives some
liart for their <m>charcoal</m>. Afterwards they pass it over a
grindstone to cut it down. Then they lay it down on the chameau<m>,</m>
and with some powdered <m>emery</m>, fine and soft as flour, and soaked
with <m>oil</m> to make it take, they polish the sword with the stick
used to take off the tracks left by the grindstone and then they clean
the blade well with the <m>emery</m>. And they add a drop or two of
<m>oil</m> spread with the finger to give it luster. Once the <m>oil</m>
is applied, they polish it again on the chameau with the "felin" which
is a thunderstone mounted on the middle of a stick like the "fustée."
And this stick is called the "felindel" stick. Once they used the
"felin," they polish it again with some <m>chalk</m> and the <m>oil</m>
            <x>already</x> on the sword. After they follow this and going over it
again, they polish it with dry <m>chalk</m>. Finally when they are
finished with mounting <x>of the pommel and guard</x>, they give it a
sharp edge with a file. They then dry it and sharpen it and furbish it
again with some dry <m>chalk</m>. At the end when they are completed and
mounted, they give it <x>the blade</x> a sharp edge with a grater.</ab>

         <ab>They are polished on a false mounting with the guards which are
present in order to find out if they work well together. And employing a
blade of the sort of which all the sizes should be made in the hand, one
conjectures whether it will be as strong when mounted.</ab>

         <ab>One puts the blade in a vice between two pieces of <m>wood</m>, then
with a file, they enlarge <x>it</x> if needed for attaching the guard.
Then to clench it, one positions the place to be riveted and the pommel
on a piece of <m>wood</m>. And with a hammer, one beats on the top to
make it very level and to secure the pommel. Then with the hammer, one
finishes the rivet when the hammer is well secured and does not shake.
The <m>wood</m> is placed so as not to put gashes in the pommel.
Afterwards one makes a place for the rivet with a file or chisel. And
some make the rivet <x>or attachment</x> in a diamond-shape but this is
not as good as a round <x>topped one</x> because one cuts oneself on the
corner of the rivet.</ab>

         <ab>The end can be bought already made, a dozen of small ones costs six
sols but the big ones 2 carolii.The end is fixed either with nails which
are fixed on the sides of the cutting edge, but this only spoils the
sword and rots the scabbard for the water goes into it via the juncture
of the nail. The best way is to apply some <m>resin</m> or <m>glue</m>
but the <m>resin</m> is better. And the best is when the end is tightly
set and so hot when set that powdered <m>resin</m> on the end melts, in
that way it doesn't fall and can't be undone unless it is put in
fire.</ab>

         <ab>Hilts are of different types:

Ornate

Guttered which is with round mouldings

<m>Pearled</m>

Scarfed when the bands are crosswise

Onioned which is with a flat head

In the King's manner, fully covered </ab>

         <ab>The <pro>furbishers</pro> buy them by dozens, the dozen of full ones
costs 10 lb. the worked one, 30 sols or <x>more</x> depending on its
nature.</ab>

         <ab>The first thing that the <pro>apprentice</pro> does is to furbish as
said.</ab>

         <ab>And then to adorn the sword and make a scabbard which is the summum
of the art.</ab>

         <ab>They buy scabbards' <m>wood</m> pieces which are wholly made of
<m>beech wood</m>, a hundred for 15 or 20 or 30 sols, depending on how
far they are made.</ab>

         <ab>Theses <m>wood</m> pieces are thus called estelles, and have to be
very clean and without any knots and are one finger thick.</ab>

         <ab>Then the <pro>furbisher</pro> puts them on a small bench, called a
scabbard bench and with a small <m>iron</m> tool similar to the
<pro>joiners</pro>' bench, they maintain it firmly. Then with a plane,
which is like a two-handled knife, they work the <m>wood</m> piece from
the top, then use the <pro>joyner</pro>'s plane to flatten it more.
Afterwards, the inside is scoured with a</ab>

round <tl>plane</tl>, also two-handed, and then with a small narrow
<tl>plane</tl>, it is gutted and scoured for half a foot towards the end
of the heel. And a shorter scouring is better so that the sword does not
always cut the scabbard.</ab>

         <ab>

The opening of the scabbard is called the mouth and on top of it is the
shape of the knife.</ab>

         <ab>

The stitch which is a <m>leather</m> rim set on the edge of the knife
shape is made to stop the sword frogs.</ab>

         <ab>

When the small planks are well flattened, the sword is laid down on them
and with a <tl>black stone</tl> one marks the width and length of the
blade. Then with a <tl>chisel</tl> the excess is cut. And a
<tl>plane</tl> is used to even properly following the marks.</ab>

         <ab>

Then the two small planks are stuck edge to edge <add>and all
around</add> only following the knife shape and not elsewhere. And this
is to make the scabbard <m>velvet leather</m> hold.</ab>

         <ab>

Then the sword is put in the small planks and it is set in the scabbard
which is sewed. And they rub what is glued directly on the knife shape
with some <m>tallow</m> to run into the scabbard.</ab>

         <ab>

The scabbard is made of <al>calf</al> or <al>sheep</al> 
            <m>leather</m>,
the <al>calf</al> ones are in all one piece, but not the <al>sheep</al>
ones. When swords are long, they are made of several patches sewn
between <m>leather</m> and <m>flesh</m> and then they rub firmly the
stitching with a <m>boxwood</m> piece to cover and even it. From a good
<al>calf</al> 
            <m>skin</m>, 8 or 9 or 10 scabbards can be made. A
<pro>workman</pro> can easily make 6 a day. If they are too thick, they
are lightly thinned out with a plane. If the <m>skin</m> is too hard, it
is lightly dipped in some lukewarm <m>water</m> but not for long. Next,
the same worker who worked <m>wood</m> piece has to adjust the scabbard
in order for it to be well done. It is true that for common people,
there are some good already all made, but they never fit perfectly. When
the scabbard is made and sewed with black <m>thread</m>, it is rubbed
with a <m>boxwood</m> piece or a slightly <m>oiled</m> cloth . The good
<al>cow</al> 
            <m>leather</m> scabbard is the best of all and costs also
more than all except the <m>velvet</m> ones. Under the <m>velvet</m> one
usually put plain <m>canvas</m> or a <al>sheep</al> 
            <m>skin</m> scabbard
or a <m>parchment</m> layer. But the best scabbard is a waxed scabbard
covered with either <m>velvet</m> or <al>calf</al> 
            <m>skin</m>. One
covers the wood with thin canvas, which one then waxes, and covers in
<m>velour</m> or <al>calf</al> 
            <m>skin</m>. A <m>waxed</m> scabbard is
worth at least 30 cents, a <al>cow</al> leather one, 20 cents. </ab>

         <head>Grey hilts</head>

         <ab>When they are white, it is necessary only to clean them well, and
then to heat them over a fire, and make them turn blue. And take good
care that they do not turn too blue, since neither <m>gold</m> nor
<m>silver</m> nor any color would set. To accomplish this, which is
called <fr>les faire passer</fr>, have a caldron full of <m>ashes</m>
that you cover with some <m>blazing hot charcoal</m>, and heat the
<m>ashes</m> thus very well, for an hour or two. And when the
<m>ashes</m> are very hot, put the <m>charcoal</m> aside and put the
hilt where the <m>charcoal</m> was, and cover it completely with
<m>ashes</m>. And when the body, which is the main part of the hilt, is
completely colored, flip it onto the other side. In that way, the grey
cannot color it too dark, unless some <m>hot coal</m> touches it.
Greying can be achieved in an ordinary fireplace, too, but there is a
danger that it may sit there too long and make a crust which which will
prevent the color from setting. Blue coloring is obtained as soon as the
<m>ashes</m> have heated the hilts a little bit, but it will always be
grey on some sides. After blue comes grey.</ab>

grey. Next, when they are still moderately hot, pass the
<m>bloodstone</m> over them, and when they cool, one turns them to
reheat them, for the color of water is made only by several goes. And if
the guards were not warm, the <m>bloodstone</m> would scrape &amp; undo
the color. One needs to heed that guards do not pass too grey, for they
would give off filth that would prevent the color from taking. One needs
almost one <ms>
               <tmp>day</tmp>
            </ms> for preparing, softening, &amp;
setting the color of water, but as they pass a little blue, it is enough
for grey &amp; another color. Grey is the lesser color after

         <ab>One prepares the guards thoroughly with a soft, very <tl>soft
file</tl> such that there is nothing black left on any of the guards,
and next heat them, &amp; pass them as said. But to gild &amp; gild with
<m>silver</m>, they ought not to pass, except maybe a little towards
blue. Then while the guards are hot, one attaches them to a wood block
&amp; with some <tl>tweezers</tl> one layers the <m>gold</m> &amp; one
makes it sit with <m>bloodstone</m>,which is quite clean &amp; rubbed
with <m>
               <fr>pottée</fr>
            </m>. And when the guards are cold, one reheats
them, then one layers the <m>gold</m> as above. And first one gives
<del>
               <fr>de</fr>
            </del> two layers, until the entire guard is
well-adorned. And next one reheats as at the beginning, &amp; one gives
the third covering of <m>gold</m>. Then one burnishes very thoroughly
and with great force with a large <m>bloodstone</m>. <del>And</del> But
note that <add>to</add> burnish well, the guard always needs to be warm.
And to know this, <sn>one smells it &amp; brings it close to the
<bp>nose</bp>
            </sn>. For one ought not to touch with the
<bp>fingers</bp>, but one <del>grasps</del> picks it up from on top of
the warm <m>ashes</m> with a small <tl>
               <m>iron</m> rod</tl>, which has
been purposely made to go into the eye of the guard. And when it is
entirely well-polished, one rubs it very well with a <tl>
               <m>white
linen</m>
            </tl>, and the <m>gold</m> needs to be thicker &amp; stronger
than for <pro>painters</pro>. A <ms>quarter</ms> is worth fifty or LX

            <tl>file</tl>, a little coarser
<del>for</del> than for <m>gold</m>. And one makes them pass to grey, as
for gilding. And when they are warm, one needs to double the <m>leaf of

third time, with the <m>leaf</m> doubled as has been said, then burnish
them very strongly &amp; with good strength, not with the

vye</m>, a little at your discretion, because it evaporates when heated
&amp; nonetheless makes the <m>varnish</m> more desiccative. But I made
it thus: I take <m>turpentine oil</m> at discretion &amp; put in a good
bit of <m>turpentine</m>, because it remains always moist &amp; attaches
itself if one puts in too much, &amp; <m>eau de vye</m>, &amp; heat in a
<tl>varnished bowl</tl> the said <m>oil</m>, &amp; when it begins to be
very hot, I put in some <m>subtly ground mastic</m> &amp; around
<ms>one-third</ms> of the <m>oil</m> passed through a <tl>sieve</tl>
            <del>l</del>, and let reheat until it is melted, which will be soon on
hot <m>ashes</m>. Once all melted, try it on the <tl>knife</tl>, and if
you see that it has too much body, add in a little <m>turpentine
oil</m>, and if it does not have enough, add in <m>mastic</m>, and thus
it well be done. And keep it well covered so that no filth gets in. When
you want to make it, be careful to sort &amp; choose the <m>mastic</m>
that is white &amp; purified of any dirt &amp; dust &amp; black dross.
And when you wash it &amp; dry it to render it very white &amp; clean,
it will be even better. For if you do not purge it well, these
<m>
               <pa>straws</pa>
            </m> &amp; marks, pulverised into it, will remain
within the <m>varnish</m>, &amp; when you set it on white or carnation,
it will appear that they are <al>fleas</al> &amp; blemishes. Once well
chosen, pulverise it in a <tl>mortar</tl> and pass it through a <tl>very
fine sieve</tl>, and next mix it in <m>oil</m>, as is said. But if you
want to make it more carefully, extract a tear of <m>mastic</m>, as you
know, pulverise, pass, &amp; mix, and you will have something very
singular for small works. Take heed when varnishing not to breathe on
it, for this will make the <m>varnish</m> whiten &amp; take body.</ab>

         <ab>To well <m>tin</m> nails and other work, they <tl>file</tl> their
work very neatly. Then to clean it well &amp; rid it of fattiness, they
make it boil in <m>vinegar</m>, then they wipe it well with a
<tl>
               <m>
                  <pa>linen</pa>
               </m>
            </tl>. Next they heat it &amp; pass some
<m>resin</m> over top, which coats it with a shiny skin like
<m>varnish</m>. This done, they melt some <m>pure &amp; fine tin</m> in
their <m>
               <df>estamiere</df>
            </m>, which is a little square <m>iron</m>
box. And when the <m>tin</m> is well melted &amp; moderately warm, they
throw in <m>resin</m> in to burn the filth, &amp; then they let the
<tl>head of a nail</tl> or something similar soak a little, &amp; having
remained there for seven or eight <ms>
               <tmp>pauses</tmp>
            </ms>, they take
it out and shake it, hitting the top with an <tl>
               <m>iron</m>
            </tl> to
make the <m>tin</m> that is superfluous fall off, &amp; clean it with a
<tl>small stick wrapped in <m>tow</m>
            </tl>. And if it is not well
<m>tinned</m>, you will hit it hot with a piece of <m>resin</m> &amp; do
as before &amp; let it cool. When the work cools, it becomes yellow,
which is a sign that the <m>tin</m> is the right temperature. But it
becomes blue if the <m>tin</m> is too hot. Things <del>
               <fr>t</fr>
            </del>
thus <m>tinned</m> are durable &amp; are not undone like <m>tinning done
in leaf</m>, thus at the end of a <tmp>year</tmp> they can be clarified
&amp; renewed by heating &amp; rubbing them.</ab>

boils on the fire &amp; makes bubbles, being pressed by the fire. I

cannon mouth is bigger than the bullet in order to avoid drilling, since
the material can be easily cast and slides. The drill should not be like
a dovetail, or a point, but should be cut in round like a crankshaft. If
it breaks, don't leave it to rust <figure>+</figure>

thick, because being thick &amp; in great heat, it retracts. Therefore,

. Next separate with the point of the <tl>pen-knife</tl> the bark &amp;
open it from the cleft in the middle, and having neatly lodged your
shield so that nothing comes out but the sprout, bind it well &amp; wrap
it entirely with a <tl>

         <ab>Next, when it will be well taken, cut the top of the tree that
exceeds your tree, three or 4 fingers above the shield for the first
time, and then, at the closest point, in order that is closed. But heed
well that when you will make your shield no small hole remains at the
back of the sprout, for this would signify to you that its root would be
broken, &amp; your graft would never take; but make it so that the back
is intact. This type of grafting is practiced from mid-May, so that the
trees have already budded &amp; made new output, until the beginning of
August, and so that the trees are in sap. Almond trees, which are
naturally drier, lose their sap earlier, therefore those who want to
graft onto them mericotons, apricots &amp; grafts of trees with pitted
fruit, which are the best there, they are grafted in the month of
January. Generally trees with pitted fruit, like <fr>mericoton</fr>
peaches, are grafted in clefts. One says that trees grafted <fr>en
piolet</fr> or <fr>escusson</fr> are later to bear fruit than those
<fr>en fente</fr>.</ab>

from beneath, made by kneading or by mills, from where the
<al>nightingale</al> is quite pleased, put some on your hat attached
with a pin or otherwise, in order that it wiggles. And at five or six
steps from the hedge where it sings, make a hole in the soil &amp; put
in some <al>worms</al>, and your device of little criss-crossed sticks.

them</pn> did not take this into account, &amp; assured me that there
was no trick to it, other than, when taking it, he would pull it, a
little pressed &amp; held tightly by the neck, &amp; passing it under a
shoe, he would flatten it in such a way that it would render

venomous things that it had in its stomach, and that after this, it does
not have the strength to bite, and if by chance it should bite or expel
through its bottom some filth, he would only dig the

In three, it is almost as thin that it will be after it does not eat.
Molding it as soon as it is caught is best, before it becomes thin. One

<al>frogs</al> &amp; not dead ones to eat, for if you keep them without
feeding them, they wither &amp; grow thin, &amp; have long wrinkled

bottle or vessel</tl> so that it collects no dust. And put inside a
sufficient quantity of <m>good vinegar</m> &amp; <m>urine</m> so that it
can be covered. And shake &amp; torment it inside, until it is dead,

And if the end of the tail, or the end of a nail or a leg ought to be

first thing you pour on the animal should be a little clearer than the

Then dip a little the whole <tl>mold</tl> evenly, at the level of the
joints, in <m>water</m>, for this is another secret to disjoint them,
otherwise you will break everything. Separate them nimbly, therefore by
this mean, and next, extract gently &amp; with patience and immediacy
the half of the animal remaining in one of the <tl>molds</tl>,
<del>for</del> pulling it sometimes from one side &amp; sometimes from

If after both halves of the noyau have made a strong &amp; hard set, you

However, take heed your second <tl>mold</tl> be of good thickness &amp;
that it is hard enough because if it is lacking in this, after having

that it breaks. Take heed therefore to avoid this, and wanting to open
it, dip all of it in <m>water</m>, <add>and rub it everywhere</add>,
where it will harden if it has set well.Then, take your two
<tl>molds</tl>, joined with a <tl>rough <m>linen</m> cloth</tl>, in in
order to have a better grip, and separate them with strength as if you
wanted to quarter a loaf of <m>bread</m>. But if happens to break, join

if you want, which will be enough, or else on the two halves. But
because one needs to cast by the tail or from the back of the animal,
make it so that the vents come from the head &amp; the middle of the
body to respond to the tail, where the cast is done, which is the end of
the mandore. And having done your cast, do not forget to make in it some
holes and notches because the metal will run more neatly, as if the cast
was even, for it gets corrupted in its notches &amp; holes, &amp;does
not go so much at once, &amp; does not become as porous. This done, join
the two halves of your mold &amp; strengthen the joints, putting around
these some small clamps of iron wire of this shape. They prevent the
molds from deforming &amp; corrupting while reheating.</ab>

you fix &amp; arrange it on the clay <fr>tourtelle</fr>, and next it
happens that when you have cast your wet sand on it, &amp; it has set,
it ends up coming out such that between the snake and animal there is a
line of distance, in which enters the second batch of cast wet sand.
Avoid this therefore if you can. But if this cannot be, do not let this
prevent your second cast, for the sand which will enter in this void,
will be so weak that it will easily be removed with a small point, &amp;
will not have set with the first hardened one.</ab>

inside burns, then pass some quicksilver inside &amp; attracting the
ashes &amp; the burnt bones from the inside, it will also come out,
because the conduit is big, &amp; thus will not sour at all your

soft &amp; malleable &amp; obedient &amp; the mold, having set, is so

         <ab>After your molds have been reheated &amp; and cleaned, the sooner
casted is best, because if you keep them, they get corrupted and
dampened. Reheat the thickest, where the body of the animal is, cast as
soon as possible, because if you keep your molds it will corrode and
become damp. Reheat the thickest part, where the body of the animal is,
at the top, so that , if there is something inside to burn, it falls to
the bottom.</ab>

         <ab>If the <m>plant</m> or <m>flower</m> that you want to cast is
delicate &amp; fine, it is necessary that the <m>tin</m> exceeds
<m>lead</m> in the mixture &amp; on the contrary, if it is thick, it is
necessary that lead exceed. Therefore for the fine thing, put in some
fine tin, not all the quarter part of lead. And make sure that your mold
is hottish, such that you can hold it in your hand, when you want to
cast. As for the alloyed <m>tin</m>,the same as mentioned, it is
necessary that it is very hot &amp; almost red for casting, so that it
penetrates. Otherwise, having to run the length of the fine branches of
the plant, it will get cold before arriving there. And no forget to mix
in it a little <m>looking-glass tin</m>, which makes it run better &amp;
firms it up.</ab>

make at the end of the forge, or in some clean place, a surrounding of
bricks, and fill it with large half lit charcoal. And place your molds
on top, and leave the charcoals thusly to light by themselves for a half
hour, so that they heat little by little and not all at once. Finally as
they begin to become white, beat the thusly half-lit large charcoals on
top &amp; blow with your little bellows, until they are warmed. And
thusly, little by little, invigorate the fire, without haste, until you
molds are well red on the outside &amp; the inside. If it is for casting
some plant or some animal which does not release well &amp; in this
case, one needs to burn it in the mold &amp; when you look through the
gate &amp; through it you see the molds are very red &amp; inflamed
inside,this will be your signal that they are reheated enough. But if
you do not see this signal, increase &amp;continue the fire until it is
the case. If there is nothing in the mold that needs burning, it will be
enough that they are dried well on the same fire, if it is for casting
tin, they reheat better in a reverberatory furnace.</ab>

         <ab>For delicate <pa>plants</pa> &amp; other <pa>flowers</pa> or thin

exceed by more than three parts. Heat the mostly <m>tin</m> mixture,
until it is almost red &amp; very hot. And when you want to cast, in
removing your crucible from the fire, throw in two or three grains of
<m>resin</m>, &amp; for one <ms>lb</ms> &amp; a half or two of
<m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>, put with the resin as much looking glass tin

sure that there is more of the <m>metal</m> than is needed, in order
that some is left. However, if there is not enough, finish casting,
&amp;it will take. But it will not be so neat. After, dip your mold into
<m>water</m>, &amp; with a point release it carefully, so that nothing
is spoiled. Make your <tl>cast</tl> elongated. If the material is very

         <head>A means to mold <pa>flowers</pa> and <pa>plants</pa>
         </head>

         <ab>One needs to choose them in their full verdure &amp; vivacity, &amp;
<del>les mou</del> not pick them, if possible, until the time one will
want to mold them, so that they do not wilt. Or if you need to carry
them from afar, soak their stems in a bottle of <m>water</m>, or better
still <m>wine</m>. Make, firstly, a <m>wax</m> stick pointed like a big
peg, of a size appropriate to what you want to cast, as you see in the
margin, marked A. Put &amp; prick at the foot of this small peg a bit of
<m>iron</m> wire, rather thick &amp; strong. And at the point of this,
you will fit your <pa>flower</pa> stem or your <pa>plant</pa>. This
done, set it aside neatly. And arrange your <del>mold of t</del> circle
and shape of <m>clay</m> as you have done for the <al>snakes</al>, in
the form of a <mu>mandore</mu> 
            <del>in such a way that</del> according
to the size of your <pa>plant</pa>. Then take the one that you have
prepared to be cast, as we have taught you, &amp; wet &amp; moisten it
very carefully with good <m>eau de vie</m> with a <tl>pinceau</tl>. Then
pass the wire stem through the end of the <m>earthen</m>
            <mu>mandore</mu>, in order that the <m>wax</m> peg, where the
<pa>plant</pa> is fastened, joins to the end of the <m>earthen</m>
            <mu>mandore</mu>. And arrange thusly your <pa>plant</pa> in such a way
lying down that it remains in the middle of aforesaid <mu>mandore</mu>,
without touching on either side, so that <del>a</del> the sand that you
will pour in it will be of equal thickness <del>as</del> everywhere,
&amp; <corr>
               <del>is</del>
            </corr> exceeds everywhere by the height of two
good <ms>fingers</ms> the top of the <del>such</del> 
            <pa>plant</pa>. And
having secured the wire stem well, pour quickly <del>wet</del> your
<m>wet sand</m>, much clearer than the one for snakes, in the
<mu>mandore</mu>. And the sooner the better, in order that the <m>eau de
vie</m> does not dry. And take heed to put in a little more <m>water of
sal ammoniac</m> among the common than you would do for the snakes. And
when you will make sand especially for your bouquets, where you would
mix in a little more <m>feather alum</m>, it will be that much better.
Thus your mold will be in one piece and it will not be necessary to take
it apart, but rather <del>leave</del> separate it from the <m>clay</m>
once it will have set, let it dry, and then reheat it again until the
plants are burnt. And note that if the plant you want to cast has a
strong stalk &amp; stem, you can cast it lying down, as had been said.
But if it is some weak &amp; delicate flower, <del>cast</del> plant it
upright with the <m>wax</m> peg because the sand will always
<del>cast</del> lift it up, it being very clear. Do not forget to adapt
two vent holes with two small <tl>sticks</tl>, starting at the foot of
the cast, which is the pointed end of the <m>wax</m> peg.</ab>

If the <pa>plants</pa>s are so delicate that they rise to the top when
you pour the <m>wet sand</m>, one can stop and contain them with a
<m>thread</m> passed through the circle of the mold with a
<tl>needle</tl>.</ab>

         <head>Casting in <tl>frames</tl>
         </head>

         <ab>The same sand that was used in the reheated <fr>noyaulx</fr>,
composed, as is said, of <m>plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> &amp; <m>
               <fr>alum
de plume</fr>
            </m> , is excellent for casting in <tl>frames</tl>, and I
have experienced it thus: I crushed the pieces which had come out of
molds <fr>en noyau</fr> in a <tl>mortar</tl>, dragging the
<tl>pestle</tl>, because this sand is very <fr>doulx</fr>. I did not
pass it through the <tl>sieve</tl>, because the <m>
               <fr>alum de
plume</fr>
            </m> mixed throughout, which binds it, would not pass; but I
ground finely upon <tl>marble</tl> what seemed to me too coarse. And
having prepared it thus, I moistened it with <m>sal ammoniac water</m>,
made of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, as much as the size of two
<ms>
               <pa>walnuts</pa>
            </ms>, in a bottle of <m>common water</m>, the same
size as a <tl>bottle</tl> in which one boils <m>tisane</m>, or in a good
<tl>pot</tl> of <m>water</m> so that you find the <m>water</m>
moderately salty. I mixed throughout <del>
               <m>water</m> of</del> half a
<ms>glass</ms> of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, <del>two othe</del> two <del>au
t</del> 
            <tl>silver spoonfuls</tl> of <m>
               <fr>eau de vye</fr>
            </m>.
<del>J’a</del> Having thus moistened the sand in such a way that it took
hold well, nevertheless coming apart easily, I sprinkled my medal with
<m>pulverized charcoal</m> with a <tl>file</tl>, to rid it of
<m>oil</m>, and all other <m>grease</m>, that are necessary to avoid,
for they <del>make</del> would hinder a good release. I blew on my medal
&amp; molded it, and the female part of the <tl>frame</tl> once filled,
I marked &amp; made a line on the reverse <del>of the</del> &amp; edge
of the medal, &amp; on the nearby sand as well. In order that the second
<tl>frame</tl> 
            <del>s’em</del> take the imprint thereupon to denote the
place for making the cast, <del>once filled</del>
            <del>the female part of
the box mold once filled</del> I uncovered the outline of the medal and
pounced the whole side with <m>pulverized charcoal</m>, and then filled
the male part with sand. <del>Once mad</del> I separated the
<tl>frame</tl> and did not hit the corners of the <del>d</del> medal to
make it release, because that knocks the sand &amp; makes it
<del>esp</del> crumble. Rather I struck the back of the <tl>frame</tl>,
retaining the obverse of the medal on the bottom, and it molded very
neatly. If it had not stripped thus, I would have waited to remove it
until the <tl>frames</tl> had been dried out over fire. I lit
<del>the</del> a row of <m>charcoals</m> between two little
<tl>trivets</tl> of <m>iron</m> in the form that you see, and put the
back <del>the</del> &amp; reverse of the <tl>frames</tl> thereupon,
&amp; the imprint on top, <figure>

               <id>fig_p118v_1</id>

               <link>https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-oNrvWdlO5Rm5qaUJCNWVFWlk</link>

            </figure>

because in this way, they dry out gently. And if, by chance, they should
crack from being too moistened, it is on the back,which <del>pr</del>
takes the harshest fire, &amp; the imprint remains safe &amp;
whole.</ab>

         <ab>

For the best, one needs to reheat the sand used in the <fr>noyau</fr>
before using it in the <tl>frames</tl>, until it no longer
contracts.</ab>

         <ab>Take a little of the same sand, the finest that you can, to cover

         <ab>

Note that I filled the <tl>frame</tl> before pressing it, and did not
hit it at all, but rather pressed it only with the strength of my
<bp>hands</bp>, because hitting it makes it go awry. Secure your
<tl>frame</tl> that it does not shift at all, &amp; if you put some
moistened sand under it, it will only hold in place more firmly.</ab>

         <ab> As I saw that they did not smoke anymore, &amp; that, scratching
the back &amp; the front of the cast &amp; having found that they are
rough &amp; firm &amp; hard on one side and the other, which is a good
sign of their being quite dry, I left them to cool. I took some fine
<m>tin</m> 
            <del>f</del>, one <ms>lb</ms>, &amp; one ounce of <m>lead
fine &amp; new</m>. I melted it in a crucible until it was <del>a
little</del> like a bit red. Being in this way quite hot <del>I smoked
&amp; not p</del> &amp; being ready to cast &amp; not before, I smoked
with the smoke of a <m>tallow candle</m> all sides of my frames &amp;
imprints &amp; cast &amp; everything. I set my frame, well joined, in
the press. I drew my crucible from the fire. I left it a bit
<del>pass</del> so that the redness at the bottom of the crucible could
fade. And wanting to cast, I threw in two or three grains, like pitch
rosin, &amp; when &amp; when the measure of a bean of <m>looking-glass
tin</m> &amp; I mixed, &amp; stirred a little the crucible, and I cast.
And the medal came out as neat as the original. I smoked it with the
candle &amp; cleaned it with <tl>small brushes</tl>.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-middle</margin>
Always cast through the foot of the medal because the head, which is
lower, will come out better, &amp; make the cast longish. And when you
will cast in a large frame several medals, they will come out
better.</ab>

         <head>Advice about the above</head>

         <ab> Good <m>tin</m> is that which is hard as <m>silver</m> &amp; soft
nevertheless. If your work is thin, it must be almost all <m>tin</m>
&amp; alloyed as is said.</ab>

         <ab>
            <m>Looking-glass tin</m> must not be <del>smoked</del> mixed until
the instant that you want to cast.</ab>

         <ab> Nor must the forms be smoked until then.</ab>

         <ab> If the <m>sand</m> shrinks in the frame, this means that it must be
reheated &amp; reddened on the fire.</ab>

         <ab>Good <m>sand</m> when moistened does not stick at all to the hand
when pressed.</ab>

         <ab>The perfect <m>sand</m> for the frame is <m>
               <fr>aspalt</fr>
            </m>
which is found in Germany, which is soft as <m>flour</m> 
            <del>&amp;
almo</del> when wet, and almost all the others are lumpy.</ab>

         <ab>

            <rub>Nota</rub> that the cast must be thin &amp; hardly thick in order
that it does not overtax the material at all, and must not exceed the
thickness of the width of a grain of <m>wheat</m>, likewise for
<m>tin</m>, that wants to be cast very thinly. For <m>lead</m>, a little
thicker. There is no need to make the vents very large &amp; deep
either.</ab>

         <ab>
For frames, the <m>sand</m> that you use for the <fr>noyau</fr> of the
composition aforementioned is excellent. But in washing, crushing &amp;
reheating it several times, it must be corrupted from its nature &amp;
so that it will no longer be fit to grip &amp; for molding <pro>en
noyau</pro>.</ab>

         <head>Way to prepare <del>aspalt</del> spat</head>

         <ab>It is found in earth in <pl>Germany</pl>, the color of cooked
plaster, made of long filaments, very soft to handle. And because it is
mixed with earth and filth, one pestles it roughly &amp;one makes little
balls, having, for this purpose, soaked it in <m>sal ammoniac</m>
            <m>water</m> of such a composition that you were told above. One places
these balls to reheat in the fire of the furnace of the potters, then
one soaks it again in the same <m>water</m>. The earth and the
coarseness and go to the bottom, and the pure <m>aspalt</m>, which is
light &amp; soft and handleable as wet <m>flour</m>, adheres with the
<m>water</m> and goes to the surface, clouding the <m>water</m>, empty
that cloudy part in a separate receptacle. Having sat, one, one empties
the <m>water</m> by tilting, or by taking it away with a sponge, and the
pure<m>aspalt</m> remains at the bottom. Dry it &amp; employ it in
frame, having been moistened with <m>sal ammoniac</m> 
            <m>water</m>. And
try it in the frame, in which it shrinks when reheated or dried, that is
to say that one needs to reheat it again on a good fire and redden it.
Thus, for medals and flat things, you should use this one, because it is
the most perfect of all for <m>gold</m>, <m>silver</m>, <m>copper</m>,
<m>lead</m>, <m>latten</m>, &amp; <m>tin</m>, for it withstands the fire
&amp; reddens whenever need be, without corrupting. The more it is used,
the <del>b</del> better it is, &amp; it does not spoil. At the beginning
it is white, &amp; being used it becomes grey. However make sure to put
aside the one that served for casting <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> &amp;
<m>latten</m>, for <m>gold</m> would sour in it, &amp; would not come
out of it well. And to do this better, you could put it aside to be used
for each metal. </ab>

It endures ten or twelve castings without corrupting, it withstands the
fire &amp; reddens, it is suitable for all metals. It is so tenacious
that should the frame be straked, it holds.

            <m>Sand</m> for casting in <m>gold</m>
         </head>

         <ab>Take <m>common sand</m> of <m>alum</m>, of <m>plaster</m> &amp;
<m>brick</m>, according to the composition as said above. Add to it some
more <m>alum de plume</m>. And mix in not the whole of a third part of
<m>crocum ferri</m>. However its quantity cannot be harmful, for it is
that which receives the gold, &amp; thanks to which it comes out very
neatly. But it is good that your <m>crocum</m> will have been previously
in the furnace of <pro>glassmakers</pro>, three <del>or four</del> days
and <del>three days</del> and three nights, in a flat box, where it will
be not very thick, so that it will reheat better.</ab>

You could cast well <m>gold</m> in <m>common sand</m> of
<pro>goldsmiths</pro>, should you add some substance that makes it run.
Before the invention of <m>crocum</m>, one would cast flowers in
<m>silver</m>, but not at all in gold. It has not been forty years that
one knows this in Germany.</ab>

            <m>Sublimate</m> is commonly employed by <pro>goldsmiths</pro> for
<m>gold</m>. Some add <m>sulphur</m>, but they &amp; others are wrong,
for <m>sulphur</m> sours, even as it heats. And the <m>sublimate</m> is
agitated, boils and bubbles. It is very good to clean <m>gold</m>
because by its exhalations, it draws everything out as it goes up in
smoke. But to warm <m>gold</m>, &amp; conserve its heat, there is only
the color, which is <m>verdet</m>, <m>sal ammoniac</m>,
<m>saltpeter</m>, &amp; <m>borax</m>. This makes it run &amp; you can
throw in a branch of wormseed.</ab>

         <ab>a sign that there is some humidity, and if the flower was also
somewhat watery it would rot. Nor should it be <del/> too rough, because
its weight would burden the flower and make it lose its original shape.
Once you have chosen it as needed, take a <tl>box</tl> and inside this
start by making a small mound of sand on top of which you will lay the
stalk of the flower flat, so that the flower touches neither the bottom
nor the edges of the <tl>box</tl> but remains in the air. Then add more
<del/> sand on the stalk so that it remains firm and fixed. Finally take
some of the same sand and pulverize and sprinkle it finely with two
<tl>
               <bp>fingers</bp>
            </tl> on the flower, imitating the flow of an
<ms>
               <tl>hourglass</tl>
            </ms>. And once the flower is <del/> half covered
or so, strike with your <bp>
               <tl>fist</tl>
            </bp> the table on which the
<tl>box</tl> is laid, so that the sand drops and enters everywhere.
Finally cover the entire flower and lay other flowers in order, one over
the other, as many as the <tl>box</tl> will hold. After you have
arranged them thus, put the <tl>box</tl> out in <env>hot sun</env> for
<ms>
               <tmp>several days</tmp>
            </ms>. And while the flower is drying, the
sand that is packed together, by continuously holding it, does not allow
it to shrivel and shrink. On the contrary, it needs to dry remaining in
the same state as when you put it there. But to that effect take care
you chose <pa>knapweed</pa>s, <pa>marigold</pa>s, the <pa>yellow meadow
flowers</pa> called <la>
               <pa>ranunculus</pa>
            </la> or <la>
               <pa>palta

<pa>broom</pa> and others that you will know from experience.</ab>

The sand that <pro>goldsmith</pro>s use to rub <m>enamel</m>s and the
white one that <pro>glassworker</pro>s use and any thin sand that does
not set, you put through a <tl>sieve</tl> made of <m>horsehair</m>
because it needs not be too thin. Then dry the sand well in the
<env>sun</env> for <ms>
               <tmp>several days</tmp>
            </ms> in order to remove
its humidity, and ventilate it as you would do with <m>wheat</m> so that
the dust becomes separated from it. After taking that dust, well dried,
use it as you know.</ab>

            <tl>jars</tl> for preserves. Protect them with
<m>straw</m> or something else so that they may not break, and seal them
well with <m>wax</m> so that they may not breathe. And if they have

better. Put them in a <tl>case</tl> and put this in the <env>well</env>,

done to accommodate more delicate works and the other, which is wide and
in one piece, works better for flat medals. But take heed that all gates
be very thin close to the medal &amp; almost not as thick as the medal,
if it is not very thin like paper. And then, from the medal towards the
gate, thicken it as it goes, for it comes better thus. If the gate is
thick, at the entry to the medal, the work will never come out well.
Make that, <del>desp</del> from the middle of the gate to the top it is

<fr>four à vent</fr>, &amp; at the beginning, give slow fire, as much
for reheating your crucible than for gently letting the fury of the
<m>saltpeter</m> pass. Then, invigorate little by little &amp; with
judgment the fire. And <del>y</del> leave in the fire’s full vigor, your
substances, for 12 hours, or a natural day. Make each time a good
quantity of this substance, to not repeat it often, because the fumes,
which are dangerous, could hurt you. And before working at it, take in
the morning good buttered toast, and hold the said <m>butter</m>, or
<m>zedoary</m>, or <m>gold</m> coins, in your mouth, and <del>ada</del>
cover your face with a cloth from the eyes down. From this mass, the

Thusly, do as you make fine <m>tin</m> on <m>copper</m>, &amp; for

you put it in too great a quantity, likewise, the grain composed of the
above-mentioned substances would sour your silver if <del>l</del> you
were to put in too much, and obscure it. This above-mentioned
composition will suffice you for a long time, when it has been for a
whole day on a <del>gentle</del> gentle fire at the beginning &amp;
invigorated degree by degree until the end. Then, having given it one
load of charcoal, let it consume it by itself, &amp; let your
<tl>crucible</tl> cool. Next, break it. You will find two hard slabs
&amp; <fr>tourtelles</fr> in the <tl>crucible</tl>. The upper one is
like petrified <del>Once</del>, composed of <m>salts</m> sublimated
&amp; mixed together. The lower one is metallic, composed of fillings,
<m>aes ustum</m> &amp; <m>antimony</m>, having the grain very small.
Pulverize the upper <fr>tourtelle</fr>, made from <m>salts</m>, &amp;
put some to clear &amp; clean the <m>silver</m>, and the metallic grain
can be used to put in the melted metal.</ab>

         <ab>Animals with hair are awkward to mold because the hairs raise up
&amp; come out looking mixed up &amp; <del>to</del> clumped together.
Starting, one ought to keep it flat with something dessicative &amp;
that makes it firmer. And in this, the most singular thing is <m>wheat
oil</m>, with which you will smear it. Once cast, you will be able to
repair it. The bodies of <m>butterflies</m> and <m>plants</m>, that have
the <m>stem</m> &amp; the <m>leaves</m> that are wooly with some hair,
capricious &amp; downy, need also to be smeared with the same
<m>oil</m>, to keep these hairs laid down; likewise <m>flowers</m> that
have <m>leaves</m> very delicate &amp; thin, for dry <m>wheat oil</m>
makes them rigid and firm. And if someone brags about molding what is
presented to them, give them to mold the downy head of the plant called
<m>dandelion</m> or a <pa>pappus</pa>, which comes from the seeds of
<pa>burdock</pa> &amp; flies away at the slightest sigh of wind.</ab>

With small rolls, you make your gates and vents without danger of
crusting &amp; removing anything from the mold, because the wax, being
taken away, leaves the empty space all made. Make your vents coming from
the head, which is in the bottom, towards the cast. Make also your gate
so that it is <del>too</del> but little thick, and makes within its
course two or three notches, for this corrupts fury of the<m>metal</m>
and makes it flow with ease, without bubbling nor making too much smoke,
which hinders its run. You can divide it also in two or three branches

         <ab>When you <del>v</del> mold something to cast <m>wax</m> in it, you
mold in plaster alone, reheated after having been pulverized. For, once
reheated in <m>stone</m>, the outside is cooked, and the inside stays
almost raw. Transparent grey <m>plaster</m> is not strong, but a good
one, is one, that, once wet, is white &amp; sets very quickly.
Nevertheless I have found the grey <x>
               <m>plaster</m>
            </x> to be quite
firm and hard after it has set, but it takes longer <x>to work with
it</x>. Know the nature of each. You will never mold very neatly if you
do not soak until it is quite clear and liquid, your <m>plaster</m> or
the core's <m>sand</m>. Soak it straight away after it has been
reheated.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-middle</margin>
However, if you mold with <m>plaster</m> that has been reheated once as
said, coat the first mold well with <m>oil</m>. And when the second cast
has set and you have prepared it, soak it in <m>water</m> for a long
time. And if it does not release, soak it in hot <m>water</m>, because
cold <m>water</m> hardens it.</ab>

I molded a viper, which is much cleaner to cast than any other snake,
because it has beautiful &amp; very visible scales on the entire body
&amp; principally on the head and under the throat. It has a flat heat,
a ruddy snout tending to deep carnation, &amp; thick and short like
horned aspic or like the top of a pig's snout, big jowls, eyes very
close to the snout, and the mouth wide open where it has double canine
teeth on each side coming out of a reed of flesh that covers them and
turns back. It also has a reed of flesh in the throat like a dog's penis
from which comes its stinger. Other snakes have a double row of
teeth.</ab>

         </head>

         <ab>

When you want to cast in <m>wax</m> in a <m>plaster</m> mold, you must
know this secret, that there is need that your mold be in <m>hot
water</m>. The animal will never come out as clean as in metal, because
<m>wax</m> grips. But to rough out an animal as close to natural as
possible in order to fix it afterwards, you have to remove all the
scales, because the <m>wax</m> will permeate them &amp; will not be able
to be stripped off. In molding the animal, take off the scales for
<m>wax</m>, but on the contrary <x>when not molding with wax</x> rub
them against their grain so that they raise up, because then these
animals <x>sc. those not molded in wax and prepared in this way</x> will
show better. Do not wait to strip off your wax until it is cooled down
at all. But while it is a bit hot, after you have molded the first
casting of the animal, uncover it halfway so that it be stripped in so
doing. And having as much in one mold as in the other, make very many
large castings holding on to the animal in order to fortify them
<x>...</x> stripping, &amp; afterwards you'll cut it.</ab>

         <head>Molding fruits and animals in sugar</head>

         <ab>
            <m>Sugar</m> is fatty, and, with it, round things and large muscles
are cast well but fine and delicate things <x>are cast with</x>
difficulty. However, try well-purified <m>sugar</m>. The <m>plaster</m>
mold must be soaked in <m>water</m> for a full night or a full day
before casting <m>sugar</m> so that it <x>the mold</x> is saturated with
<m>water</m> and does not soak up the <m>syrup</m> 
            <x>the <m>sugar</m>
mixture</x>. The <x>plaster</x> mold must also be stripped very well
from it <x>the sugar</x>, because <m>sugar</m> is aigre and brittle.
Thus, do not cast anything with <m>sugar</m> which is not stripped
easily from it, and which can not be neatly molded in two parts to open
as will be needed. If you want to mold a grape, you must get it when it
is very fresh; because if it is withered, it <x>the cast</x> will look
the same. See to it, thus, that you make your molds in the natural
season for each thing <x>fruit</x>. Grapes that one wants to cast in
<m>sugar</m> are man-made, either with <m>wax</m> or <m>earth</m> or
with grapes molded with melted <m>wax</m>, on some dish <x>plaste &amp;
chose pleine</x> in a way so that they are pressed closely together and
easily stripped from it. And only a half <x>of the grapes</x> should be
molded. Or, if you have some of those grapes called chauches or
sauvignons which have well-pressed grapes, set half of the grapes in the
dish of <m>clay</m>, and cast on the other half, and if any grape is not
stripped from it, pluck it out. Note that a grape whose grapes are set
apart and separated cannot mold well in either <m>sugar</m> or
<m>metal</m> because the ends of the cluster are so fine. Similarly, if
the grape is kept, that it cannot hold the bunched grapes. Therefore, a
hollow should be cast, which you will not be capable of if the grape is
not close together and without having them spread apart.</ab>

things, because they remain as solid <m>coal</m> in the small conduits,

sand.</ab>

         <ab>This is not due to the fact that those herbs have stems with lines

when you throw in your <m>clear sand</m>, as to give them some
circulation when they are reheated. Because by doing this the thread
burns away and leaves some empty space around the herbs which acts as
vents, and places for the air to escape, and places for the air to enter
so that they burn more easily; because what keeps them carbonized, is
when they burn in a closed fire with no empty spaces because of the fine
sprigs. Therefore try to enlarge the main stem with a bit <m>melted
wax</m> and leave it to cool. Then mold it. And when the <m>wax</m>
melts, it will leave the main stem sitting comfortably and almost
loosely so that it burns better. Or you could apply some <m>petrol

things, or with <m>aqua fortis</m> or <m>spirits</m>, or make you

         <head>Founder's earth</head>

         <ab>This is boulvene earth mixed in with dung or hairs which withstands
fire, of which you must always have a large stock hanging around for
dawbing the molds that you use to cast in silver and that need
reheating. Those where you burn flowers or animals do not need dawbing,
unless they have been left to stand once they have been reheated, and
once they have been cleaned of any bones and ash that might have
remained inside. And having removed the clamps, you open the two halves
to see if they have any cracks. Because there is some plaster that does
not harden as much in the fire as another one would. Others create
crusts on the things that remain to be burned inside. And all of these
are imperfections that you must avoid, either by giving the animal a
bath of spirits before pouring your soaked sand, or by putting in more
or less brick <x>sand</x> or alum, or by reheating the brick to higher
temperature, or by instead of mixing in brick, mixing in broken bits of
crucibles and similar things that resist fire well. Having therefore
reheated your mold to burn what is inside, leave it to cool. And if it
is neat and unbroken put the clamps on again, and dawb with the
aforementioned earth, that is called of the <pro>founders</pro>, dust it
with a bit of sifted ashes and leave it to strain. But beware not to
dawb your if they are not cold. Those in which you cast silver, where
nothing needs burning inside, only need, when the cast and the vents are
made, to be dawbed and reheated once. Do not dawb the part of the mold
in which you want to cast, but leave it uncovered like the openings of
the vents.</ab>

         <ab>The molds should crack at the first reheating, because <x>then</x>
they will not crack at the second reheating anymore.</ab>

         <ab>The smallest molds reheat more quickly, therefore take the ones that
have finished reheating first when you cast, because you can put several
<x>in your furnace at the same time</x> to reheat.</ab>

         <ab>First light the coals in the forge, or in any other place that is
close, and having placed your molds on a layer of good embers, not
burning too much, in order to have a slow fire in the beginning, then
add in little by little coals that are half lit to the forge.</ab>

Earth, of the kind used to braise or solder, which is sandy clay earth.
Or else clay mixed with sand after having been dried and sieved, and
then composed, is good to dawb your molds. Because this type of earth
melts rather than cracks. And any earth that melts cannot be lacking in

         <head>Casting with <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m>
         </head>

         <ab>

To cast <m>silver</m> and <m>gold</m> do always put a little ground
stone of <m>borax</m> on the bottom of the crucible, and put your matter
on it. That way the acid <m>smoke</m> won't corrupt these two matters,
but it is especially efficient for <m>gold</m>.</ab>

         <ab>

If you have several molds to cast, do not fill them all in one cast,
because <m>metal</m> would get cold. Cast one after another.</ab>

         <ab>

When your mold start being red inside, look at the cast, if you do not
see any black spot keep the same heat, and if needed, add a few half
lighted <m>charcoals</m> with the help of pliers. However, put ground
<m>borax</m> at the bottom of the crucible, and put <m>silver</m> on the
top of this matter, then put your crucible into the forge, reheat your
crucible which is between lighted <m>charcoals</m>, until it becomes
red; do not blow before that. When you'll use the bellows, make
continuous longitudinal moves, tug a little bit the bellows, push and
pull, that way the heat will become greater. From time to time remove
your crucible out of the top of the forge with the help of your warm
pliers, because if your crucible is close to the tuyere <m>silver</m>
would cool down rather than heat up. That why it is better to put the
lighted <m>charcoals</m> above the tuelle, three fingers far from the
wall of the forge. That way the crucible is heating much better. When
your <m>silver</m> starts melting, if you find that it is too acid by
noticing that the lumps are cracking and bursting, take the size of a
walnut of <m>arsenic</m>, and twice as much of <m>crude tartar</m> which
is coarsely ground, that way it will heat better. Pour some of this
mixture on <m>silver</m> in the crucible, it will get clearer. But if
you have some of that sublimate crust on the <m>metallic matter</m>, and
which looks like grains of <m>steel</m>, <figure>#</figure> put some of
this matter in your melted <m>silver</m>.</ab>

You will see that it will stir it and heat it intensely and soon will
make it quite liquid and ready to cast, and lighten it as it should.When
it is in that state, very white and polished, shiny like quicksilver, be
ready to cast. To that end, have thin, diluted sand in a pot or other
vessel, which will be helpful to your mixture. Make a hole in your sand,
and with you pincers put your red hot mold in this sand hole. Cover
immediately the opening of your mold so that no ash or dust enters in
it, and then surround it with sand up to the level of the gate and the
vents. This done, peel off you mold and cast you well molten
<m>silver</m>, the size of a pea of this metallic grain, which will
immediately spread your <m>silver</m> all over, making it boil and cover
everything. Cast as soon as you have spread this matter; that is the
secret to make <m>silver</m> run, because its crust heats up and
lightens it up. You can cast <m>silver</m> thinner than the Capital
league <x>norm</x>, as the royal one. </ab>

         <ab>

            <margin>left-top</margin>

Don't forget to add first some <m>borras</m> in your molten
<m>silver</m>, even if <pro>silversmiths</pro> do not. However, it is
good to do it and I have seen it done. Then we add matter from the crust
twice, and then some of the metallic thing. Keep it from <ill/> that be
laid at the very end of your forge.</ab>

         <head>Whitening of cast <m>silver</m>
         </head>

         <ab>

People, even <pl>German</pl> people, commonly cast <m>silver</m> of poor
quality. Because this kind of alloy produces defects and crusts, some
<m>silversmiths</m> are eager to whiten their works, including the
coarser ones. To do this they mix an equal part of <m>tartar</m> and
<m>common salt</m> in their bullitoyre. I saw an excellent German
working that way. In my presence, he casted a lizard with a teston
league alloy, which had produced a dirty crust. To clean it, this German
boiled it in a bullitoyre with <m>tartar</m> and powdered <m>common
salt</m> mixed with common <m>water</m> on the fire of his forge. Then
he scrubbed it because he thought it was not neat enough. From this
crust he burned <m>tartar</m> on a piece of <m>paper</m> until it was
black and did not smoke anymore. Then he diluted this <m>tartar</m> into
the <m>water</m> form the bullitoyre, and covered all his
<al>lizard</al> with this. Then he put the <al>lizard</al> between red
hot charcoals in the forge, and he blew a bit. When the <al>lizard</al>
became red, he removed it, let it cool, then reheated it with the
bullitoyre mixture, and scrubbed it into clear water.</ab>

         <ab>

            <margin>left-bottom</margin>

            <figure>+</figure>

Note that the bullitoyre for <m>silver</m> is not appropriate to use in
a crucible because the <m>tartar</m> evaporates. But the vessel, being
made of <m>copper</m>, is excellent to whiten <m>silver</m> and for the
mixture which colors <m>gold</m>.</ab>

         <ab>

            <margin>left-bottom</margin>

He made sure that his <m>tartar water</m> would not boil over, because
its strength would disappear, so when this first boiling happens, remove
it from the fire and put it on again. He held this burned <m>tartar</m>
mixture put on low quality <m>silver</m> to be a secret.</ab>

lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub these parts with a rough
cloth. Because of its nature, the male ejects a kind of small lump from

Roses are molded with difficulty because of their petals, which are very

         <head>Advice about casting</head>

         <ab>Be careful that your cast is not too thick, and do not forget to
make 2 or 3 holes and notches in the conduit, when your cast is coming
near the molded thing, divide it between 3 or 4 parts like fingers, and
not deep. Thus the metal will run more gently, without preventing vapors
and smoke.</ab>

         <ab>

            <margin>right-middle</margin>

Always make the entry of you cast close to the medal and the notch, when
lumpy, it will lessens the metal's fury.</ab>

         <ab>

To cast a <al>spider</al> on a leaf, and to prevent the sand from
covering the under belly, fix a bit of melted <m>wax</m> at the end of
its tail, and bottom part of the body, with the help of a warm wire as
you know. Once the leaf has burnt and the <m>wax</m> has melted, two
small holes remain on the leaf, that will be the cast of the
<al>spider</al>.</ab>

         <head>Casting a spider on a leaf</head>

         <ab>

Usually big spiders have hairy legs, which are difficult to mold if you
do not lay hairs down flat, or if you don't burn them with the flame of
a candle, or if you stiffen them and lay them flat by <m>oiling</m> them
with <m>wheat oil</m>. Kill them into <m>vinegar</m> and <m>urine</m>,
like <al>snakes</al>, or in <m>spirits</m>. Then arrange your them on a
beautiful vine leaf, or another leaf, then you can make the
undisciplined hair look like tamed hair by rubbing them with mouth glue,
or something similar. Their true color is <m>vinegar</m> or greenish.
And season with sulphur in random places. Arrange your slab of
<m>clay</m> and place your vine leaf on it, your dead spider in the
middle. Pierce the middle of the <al>spider</al>'s body with the tip of
an <m>iron</m> or <m>latten</m> wire. Then fix diagonally some small
<m>latten</m> tacks all around the vine leafs in order to secure it.
Then block the end of the legs with a bit of melted wax using a warm
<m>iron</m> wire, and smooth it out with the tip of a pair of small
pincers. do the same with the other edges of the <al>spider</al>.

When the wax is cool, scrape away the superfluous parts with the point
of a penknife, that way the end of the legs will stay neat. Then arrange
the disc of earth around the spider, and cast your soaked sand, as you
did for others. In this fashion you will have to burn the vine leaf in
the mold. Otherwise, you will not have to. To cast your <al>spider</al>
more easily, make sure the animal is dead, avoiding the entanglement of
its legs while agonizing. When you have done your first cast, peel this
side of the leaf, then do the second cast. </ab>

feet to a small board, arrange the required position. Once they are tied
by their feet with small <m>iron rings</m>, one has to hang them upside
down into the sun. By doing so, they will get the right shape and dry,
the belly will tighten and the the tail will remain high up thanks to
the twist that you made. Once they are already a bit dry, one may twist
the head as he wishes and secure the position with any tool. One may
finish to dry the animal by placing it in an oven once the bread has
been taken off. Then place some realistically painted <m>lead</m> balls
or <m>wax</m> balls in the eye-sockets. One should paint them with
<m>gummed ink</m> so that they look like jet. One can add a painted

         <ab>It is a secret and a masterpiece to mold <x>a crab</x> well because
it is necessary to proceed differently <x>than you would</x> with other
animals, because its shell is quite difficult to <x>...</x> and that is
why it is necessary to reheat the mold three or four times. And on top
of all that, it leaves a hard crust <x>that is</x> gray like <m>ash</m>.
It is not molded from one piece and one cast, like plants. Rather, in
two casts as with serpents which are easily stripped. After it is
opened, nimbly remove this crust with the very fine point of a
pen-knife, <add>not with <m>quicksilver</m> which would do nothing</add>
and likewise those small crusts of the second cast which get into the
cavities that the <m>sand</m> or the molded animal made because it has
curved legs. Here is the subtlety and the secret of stripping it. As you
molded it <x>the crab</x> from the back side in the way <x>that you did
for</x> the others <x>animals</x>, remove the stomach and all the curved
legs from it. Make your second cast in the way <x>that you did for</x>
the other <x>animals</x>, but as it will have set, take care that you
not open the mold unless you have first reheated it well. Otherwise,
because of its curved legs, you would break the whole thing. Herein lies
the subtlety. If, after it has been well reheated and opened, you see
that the crust is not burned enough, reheat <x>it</x> until it is burned

         <head>When <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m> casts fill with bubbles</head>

         <ab>

If your casted work became porous, it can be repaired with very firm
wax, and you can gild or silver it afterwards. If you cast fine, the
alloy of one ℥ of <m>lead</m> to one lb of tin is good. But if you cast
with <m>lead</m>
            <add>
               <del>
                  <x>ligue <ill/>
                  </x>
               </del>
            </add>, indeed you
need one lb of <m>lead</m> to two ℥ of tin, because lead is fat and
sticky, goes over the alloy. I have cast a very small lizard that way.
If you cast something thick, which keep the heat for a long time, it
will make bubble if there is not enough <m>tin</m>. Your mold should not
be cold, but cool enough that you can hold it without burning your hand,
or that you can hold your finger into the cast without burning yourself.
Your <m>tin</m> or <m>lead</m> must be like red. Cast your lead first,
then cast tin. When you are going to cast, add a piece of <m>resin</m>
to your mixture, then a little <m>looking-glass tin</m>. If you add too
much <m>lead</m> to your <m>tin</m>, the mixture wouldn't be fluid
enough. To know <x>the right proportion</x>, If <m>tin</m> cries loudly,
it means that there is not too much <m>lead</m>; if <m>tin</m> cries
softly, it means that you added too much <m>lead</m>. Be wary</ab>

is a sign of good casting when <m>lead</m> comes out through the vent

         <head>How to anneal the molds</head>

         <ab>Light your <m>charcoals</m> from the forge, then place them in a
line in a corner of the forge according to the size of your mold, in
order that it be surrounded with 3 or 4 fingers of <m>charcoals</m>,
particularly at the bottom of the mole, where it is thicker. Then put
your molds on these <m>charcoals</m> -- and not on a grate as some
people do -- because they would get too strong a heat. Let your furnace
heat up gradually for a while, always adding burning <m>charcoal</m>. As
long as the mold is humid, your charcoal will be dampened at the bottom,
but when it is dry, the charcoals start to blaze. When one side of the
mold is dry, turn over; when both sides are dry and don't smoke anymore,
increase the heat and cover your mold with burning coals. When the mold
starts being red, do not blow on it with small bellows, because the mold
would burst. Similarly, when your mold becomes red-hot, keep it well
covered with burning charcoals and do not uncover it because it would
crack. Prevent the draft from a window from reaching it. Then let it
cool down.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-middle</margin>
When you want to anneal your molds, luted or not, do mark the belly of
your mold, in order to place that side at the bottom, against the
burning charcoals, because if the intensity of the heat made the mold
crack, it would be better that it do so on the bottom part instead of
the top part.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-bottom</margin>
If your mold is small, do not heat it as long, otherwise it would crack
and be damaged.</ab>

         <ab>After I processed it with <m>vinegar</m> and reddened under heat, I
had it ground very finely on the <m>porphyry</m>, until there could be
no ruggedness felt under the nails. Then I soaked it in very good
<m>vinegar</m> for 2 or 3 days, stirring the mixture several times a
day. Then I boiled it and made it red-hot in a pot, and put the whole
thing into an air furnace. I obtained a mass full of eyes, but that
crumbled finely between the fingers. I mixed half as much as <m>stone
alum</m> in the sand. I diluted the sand very thinly, and molded a very
small lizard, which molded very cleanly and finely. <m>Crocum ferry</m>
does not make the mold harder, but makes it firmer. When your mold is
soft and fat under your nail, it means that the <m>crocum</m> is good,
very fine and well prepared. You can add any quantity of <m>crocum</m>,
your mold will not be damaged because it is a friend of gold. I think it

Grind into powder the ingredients on the <m>marble</m> slab, then grind
again with very good <m>vinegar</m> until it is very fine, like a ground

         <head>Secret for soldering small works made of <m>gold</m> and

         </head>

         <ab>

If some little pieces of legs cannot be easily removed from <m>gold</m>
or <m>silver</m> casting, it is because you didn't cast <m>wax</m> under
these parts. Beat some soldering <m>gold</m> very finely, then cut it
into very fine flakes, cut the quantity you need. Take some of this
phlegm or white and thick <m>saliva</m> which is on the teeth, put some
of this matter to the place you want to solder with the point of a
burin, then place your flakes, then put to the opposite part a mixture
made of a small quantity of soaked fat <m>earth</m>and <m>saliva</m>,
thanks to the mixture the solder will better adhere. Then pulverize a
bit of <m>borax</m> on it, and heat up <m>Quince pulp seed water</m> to
a boil and others too.</ab>

It must be lengthened out with respect to the thing you have molded. And
at a minimum for large molds it must be four or five fingers in length.
You can make it large enough for half the mold &amp; then divide it in
three points of such a sort, and so the molded things will <x>each</x>
be small. But your points must be small. And in the middle of the
casting &amp; of its points, make some holes to impede the fury of the
<m>metal</m> &amp; make it run more softly. It is also necessary to fix
the bent parts of the animal with little notched lines, and similarly
the end of the tail and other fine parts so that the <m>metal</m> goes
throughout &amp; flows from one part to the other.</ab>

When you have molded an animal in the first part of the mold, do not let
this part dry out before you have removed the said animal, because when
the mold dries out it will shrink and it will also make the animal
shrink. Keep it therefore in a damp &amp; humid place until you have
done it.</ab>

To mold, take <m>vine leaves</m> as they are blooming, just as with all
<m>herbs</m> &amp; <m>flowers</m>, or a young <m>vine</m> regrowing
after it has been cut or when the leaves come off in autumn, because new
<m>leaves</m> are knottier &amp; have more evident veins. By contrast,
old <m>leaves</m> are smooth all the way through &amp; full of holes in
many places. Place therefore your <m>leaf</m>, its back behind it
against the <m>clay plaster</m>, and fasten it with little pins. Leave
it nevertheless with its natural curling. And make a notch in the clay
to hide the stem for the first cast. And when it's done and dry, take
out the stem of the <m>leaf</m> and clean it well with your jacket and
press it with a little scoop of clay. Afterwards, make many castings
around the <m>leaf</m> with <m>wax</m>, as you know well, &amp; make a
slender casting &amp; with many lines &amp; knots.</ab>

         <ab>Take a crusol that can contain a certain amount, as you wish to
place roughly crushed <m>borax</m> into it. Place <x>the
<m>borax</m>
            </x> at the bottom and then the <m>gold</m> on top of it.
Arrange the <m>coal</m> in the forge in such a way that the wind of the
bellow will blow above the crusol and no on its side as it would cool it
down and would not heat it enough. Also, make sure it is three good
<ms>
               <bp>fingers</bp>
            </ms> away from the wall of the forge so that it is
quite surrounded by <m>coal</m>. Allow the crusol to anneal until it is
quite red. Then, have your boy strongly blow the bellow with long
pushes, as in this manner it heats it better. Meanwhile, once the
<m>gold</m> will be melted, blow a small bellow above it. Because
<x>otherwise</x> the <m>gold</m> would turn sour and would acquire some
kind of coat. As long as there will be some swirling smoke as you blow
this way, it means that it is not soft enough for the cast. Therefore,
uncover the melting pot and without displacing it and without stopping
the bellow, tilt it towards you so you may well see what is inside.
Throw a ferue of <m>borax</m> in it and blow wind towards it with the
small bellow in a jerky fashion. Should there be <m>coal</m> inside,
blow a bit stronger to make them come out. And if the <m>gold</m> still
smokes and swirls, add <m>borax</m> again and blow above it. Beware that
it is still sour and not soft enough, it will show a coat when you blow
it as if it had cooled down. By contrast, if it does not show this sign,
it is soft enough. Then, blow strongly so that it <x>the <m>gold</m>
            </x>
is quite heated and once you think it is hot enough, throw colour on top
of it in the crusol and the colour should be composed as following:
<m>verdigris</m>, <m>saltpeter</m>, <m>sal ammoniac</m>, and a bit of
<m>borax</m>. And continue blowing with the small bellows, and the
<m>gold</m> will turn shiny like</ab>

and the <m>gold</m> will turn shiny like</x> a mirror. And once you will
want to <x>start</x> casting, put a bit more colour in and let it rest a
little, still blowing wind with both the small and the large bellows.
Finally, place your mold quite red between the small molds or in a
crusol full of <m>sand</m> quite hot and <x>start</x> casting. And once
it will have stuck, you may, if you wish, throw it into <m>water</m> as
<m>gold</m> does not get damaged like <m>tin</m> which breaks.</ab>

         <ab>If you have to forge a work made of <m>gold</m> on <m>brass</m>, as

back in the fire, dip it in the <m>aqua forte</m> and it will be
soft.</ab>

         <ab>It is enough for the cast to be of the same thickness as the medal,
that it from the middle of the cast, up to the medal. But if the medal
is very thick, one should not thicken the cast as a result, because a
thick cast never comes out well. It may be done large to embrace the

            <m>latten</m> casting</head>

         <ab>

Take <m>latten</m> from skillet pans, used to make baby's cereal, which
is doulx and apt for the cast. Some people say that counter from
<pl>Germany</pl> contain a lot of <m>calamine</m>. However, when they
are tempered, <m>calamine</m> evaporates, <m>calamine</m> mixed with
melted <m>latten</m> always evaporates, because <m>latten</m> becomes
red again, thanks to the reiteration of melting. However, fresh
<m>calamine</m> and only fresh <m>calamine</m>, which is blended with
remelted <m>latten</m>, makes <m>latten</m> run, and allow a clean cast.
Because <m>calamine</m> which is added to remelted <m>latten</m> is
half-damaged compared with its natural state. This half-damaged
<m>calamine</m> make <m>latten</m> porous and agitated because it has a
tendency to evaporate. Thus add only very fresh <m>calamine</m> to
melted <m>latten</m>. Make sure to cast your mold very hot, you mold
must become red-hot, like molds to cast <m>gold</m>, <m>silver</m>,
<m>copper</m> and metal. If you pour fresh <m>calamine</m>, avoid its
smoke which is pernicious. To cast a medal, I took thirty counters from
<pl>Germany</pl> and xii <m>clous de rosette</m> made of doulx
<m>latton</m>, like for claires medals which are made of soft
<m>latten</m>. This matter contains a lot of calamine like all kind of
yellow <m>latten</m>, and make a lot of smoke which prevent
<m>latten</m> from running, and make it porous, that is why it is
necessary to make many vents and to cast very hot, <m>latten</m> must be
as white as <m>water</m>, or as melted <m>silver</m> or as a polished
mirror of <m>steel</m>. The second fusion will come out much better
because evaporated <m>calamine</m> does not make as much smoke. If you
use a molding frame that does not break and holds its own, the second
<x>casting</x> will come more neatly out of the mold, because the frame
is impregnated with the smoke of <m>calamine</m>. If you add <m>sal
ammoniac</m> to your <m>latten</m>, this <m>latten</m> will be clear and
shiny, but will be even more shiny with <m>huile tingente</m>. Do not
use another sand than the above mentioned to mold a noyau, and the mold
must become red-hot, like a mold to cast <m>gold</m>. Make a lot of
vents. If you cast yellow latten with the prepared tutty you will not
get any smoke.</ab>

         <ab>

            <margin>left-top</margin>

This metal is capricious to cast because of the smoke of the
<m>calamine</m>. Do not leave it out of the fire, as some do with
<m>silver</m>. Because when air or wind touch it, the mold gets cold at
once. When you cast it, this metal always leaves burrs, like when
casting <m>glass</m>. <pro>Foundry workers</pro> do not usually use this
very yellow <m>latten</m> as much because of the <m>calamine</m> which
is heated. They cast <m>red copper</m> and turn it yellow with fresh
<m>calamine</m>, or with some prepared tutty. Before casting, clean it
with <m>charcoal</m> with a quere made of <m>copper</m> or <m>iron</m>.
Then cover it with a cloth soaked in <m>lard</m> blended with
<m>saltpeter</m>, or <m>sal ammoniac</m>, in order to protect it from
wind, which would cool it down.</ab>

         <ab>Pure cauldron <m>red copper</m>, or <m>copper</m> of any other small
works, is good to cast. To make it runny, add some <m>sal ammoniac</m>
to it, and when you are about to cast, add a little bit of <m>fine
tin</m>. One must cast the <m>copper</m> very hot into the mold, so that
it is burning and very red, like <m>gold</m>, <m>silver</m>,
<m>latten</m>, and <m>metal</m>. You will know that it is hot enough
when it is clear and shining like a newly polished <m>steel mirror</m>,
or like <m>melted silver</m>. Protect it from wind so that it doesn't
cool down too soon. Cover your cast with tow in order to prevent it from
cooling down. <m>Red copper</m> is cleaner than <m>latten</m>, which
smokes a lot, which prevents the metal from running. I have moulded it
as a noyau very neatly, and as thin as a piece of <m>paper</m>. It must
be very hot, white and shining like melted <m>silver</m>, or a mirror. I
have moulded it as a noyau with the same <m>sand</m> mentioned
above.</ab>

         <ab>

It takes more time to melt <m>copper</m> and <m>latten</m> than any

well if you cast it very hot, and as thin as <m>water</m>.</ab>

         <head>Wetting <m>sand</m> to mold flat medals</head>

         <ab>Flat medals, made of <m>wax</m> or <m>metal</m>, must be oiled very
lightly and then touched with a brush of <m>spirits</m>. So that the
already moistened mold takes well the oiled thing without rejecting it,
one warms the water well in order to wet the <m>sand</m>, because with
cold water it would be rejected. It is necessary to <m>oil</m> medals,
because they do not expand and in this way would break the mold.
Animals, which expand, do not need oiling. The hot water much be of such
a heat that you cannot keep your figure in it without it becoming too
warm. Wet the thickest <m>sand</m> for flat and solid medals rather than
<x>for</x> lizards and finer things. Once your sand has set, clean and
scrape your mold on one side and the other, and on the bottom edge of
the thrown side of the medal, make a notch so that it is easier to take
out. Lower the mold, scraping what surrounds the medal, so that on all
sides you can take it out easily without it damaging the mold. Then make
some gashes around the first mold used to throw so that the second time
that you throw in it, it will be identical to the first one, and in the
same way, make a notch at the bottom of the mold, where the held of the
item cast lies. Also make some <x>gashes</x> in the sides of the cast.
This done, wet the back of the first mold in <m>oiled water</m>, and
after the second casting moisten it with warm <m>water</m> if you have
molded your medal in a noyau mold. Having done the first cast, and this
one having set, cut around the edge of the medal with the point of a
knife so that it comes out of the throw and is not buried in it. Then
having made the second cast, and having opened your mold, take away the
medal in one go, with two knife points, one on the side of the cast
object and one on the side of the head, which is at the opposite
end.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-middle</margin>
Take care not to oil your medal too much because if the seeps out, it
prevents the <m>sand</m> from serving its purpose and coming together
and renders it wavy and lumpy. You must only touch the middle of the
medal with the tip of your oil brush and then smear the <m>oil</m>
everywhere.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-bottom</margin>

Make especially sure that the throw is as wide as you can on the medal
and holds it together well. The gate of your cast must always be big and
always narrowing as you go towards the medal. Also do not forget to
notch the gate of your cast.</ab>

         <ab>When you want to reheat your molds, fix cramp-irons on the joints,
so that when they reheat they will not bend, contract or break. This is
done once the cast is made.</ab>

         <ab>The scrapings of the mold can also be used instead of <m>bricks</m>
after being reheated, and also the leftover bits of the mold that have
already been used. You can also pat it over important things, like works
in <m>gold</m> or <m>silver</m>. You can also reheat it and blend it
with water diluted with <m>sal ammoniac</m>, like <m>spar</m> from
Germany, and is excellent <m>sand</m> for box molds for all metals.</ab>

         <ab>The molds with things that need to be burnt out inside them, those
ones will not open until the thing that is inside is burnt, like the
molds for crayfish, crab, great-horned beetles. Do not open the molds in
which you will burn something, not before the thing is burnt, it could
be crayfishes, crabs, stag beetles, pictures, and pieces of wax and
<m>black sulphur</m>, which do not come out of the mold
<x>easily</x>.</ab>

         <ab>You must not mold on <m>brick</m> or <m>wood</m> because they absorb
and attract water too early, and do not allow the sand to set. The best
place for <x>the sand</x> is on a fresh layers of <m>clay</m>. And yet,
I have experienced that <m>grey earth</m> dries out the mold too
quickly. <m>Yellow <x>earth</x>
            </m> is better.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-middle</margin>
For medals, and flat things, the <m>sand</m> must be quite thick and
moistened so that it sets quickly. And when the <m>sand</m> is thusly
thick, you can shake and move the table where you mold lies, so that
<x>the movement</x> makes the <m>sand</m> go everywhere. But when the
<m>sand</m> is clear, as for flowers and herbs, you cannot shake it, nor
can you do it when there is something attached to <m>wax</m> or other
things which are prone to come off, such as the legs of crayfish or
other similar things. And if by chance your <m>sand</m> is too thick,
you must quickly add some water. And having put the <m>sand</m> in the
water, examine it until it is thick on the bottom and clear on top. The
clearest is thrown in immediately and then bubbles and the thickest is
thrown in at the end so that it strengthens the mold.</ab>

         </head>

         <ab>
            <add>When you melt this often, it becomes sour and fragile because it
has to be cast very hot and it makes it half-calicanated. Use new
stuff.</add>
         </ab>

         <ab>The way I have done it for lizards and serpents is with two ℥ of
<m>pure tin</m> for one lb. of <m>unrefined lead</m> that is impure. The
mold is made out of the aforementioned <m>sand</m>, common for all
metals, when it is reheated, leave it to cool until you can put your
finger in it without causing a breach in the gate of the cast. As for
the <m>lead</m>, it is melted in a crucible with a bellows' fire until
both the crucible and the <m>lead</m> are red. When it gets to that
state, cleanse it anew with <m>charcoal</m> or with a specially made
scraper or with the pufts of the little bellows. This done, leave it to
rest in it red state and you can even reheat it, then if you want, throw
in a bit of <m>resin</m> to burn away the filth. However, some think it
best not to put any in because it leaves filth. But when they are ready
to cast, they cannot forget to also thrown in a bean-size quantity of
<m>bismuth</m> for each pound of <m>lead</m>. And it must be as red as
the melted metal when it enters the mold. If the mold is large, it is
much better to put in in a press so that they join well and so that the
<m>lead</m> does not come out of the mold. However, should this happen,
and that for the first, second or third time your mold does not fill up,
cast heartily because for as long as your metal is red it will mix and
join with the other one and will come out very neatly like the main one.
The same thing can be said for pure <m>tin</m> used for thin things. And
that way for doing pure <m>tin</m> is one ℥ of new <m>lead</m> for one
lb. of the former. Large molds must be put in a press held tightly
between two layers of <m>copper</m>, and then bury the whole thing in
<m>sand</m>, which is better than <m>ashes</m>, because being heavy, it
will seal better. Otherwise large molds are prone to open because the
metal is heavy. Some make square molds</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-top</margin>
When the metal is thick, you do not need to cast as hot as when it is
thin.</ab>

Note that If you want to cast with <m>cuttlefish bone</m>, they cannot
be too warm because that would burn the <m>cuttefish</m>. For this
effect, try paper. It it becomes brown, it is enough, and it is good for
casting, but if it blackens the paper, then it is too hot.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-bottom</margin>
If you want to cast paper with writing on it, make a mixture with half
<m>lead</m> and half <m>tin</m>. As soon as it is melted, throw it
between two pieces of <m>cardboard</m> on a flat place that is level.
And with a point or <m>gold</m> or <m>hard wood</m>, engrave on the left
the writing that you want. And having poured the lead onto the
<m>cardboard</m>, press onto it the other piece of
<m>cardboard</m>.</ab>

         <head>Casting <m>wax</m> to mold an animal that one has not got</head>

         <ab>Take some <m>white wax</m> which is much more appropriate for this
kind of work than anything else, because it is much firmer and does not
leave as much filth, as much as you need to cast the animal that you
propose, and no more. And <x>take</x> a half quantity of <m>ground
coal</m> and neatly sieved through a cloth or coal sleeve, using it to
give some color to your <m>wax</m>, that would otherwise be transparent
and you will not be able to see your lines as clearly. Put your
<m>wax</m> on the coal fire to melt. And when it is well-melted and
well-liquified, have, for a full eared-porringer of melted wax, as much
<m>sulphur</m> as a large walnut. Pulverize it. Melt it over a slow fire
and when it is melted, do not leave it on the fire because it will
become too hard. But take it off and keep stirring it with a little
stick and when it has finished bubbling and is as liquified as water,
cast it into the <m>wax</m> that you will have previously removed from
the fire. And mix and stir both of the them so that they join together.
After stir in little by little while continuously mixing, the
<m>charcoal</m> that has been repeatedly ground, and in this way it will
be very well incorporated. This is how you will know that your
<m>wax</m> has gone beyond its ideal heating point, it will release no
more smoke, it will start to have lines appearing on the side and not in
the middle, and those lines will be close to each other. If you cast too
hot, you will not be able to separate your wax from your mold and it
would stick to the cast. When it is at the right state, stir it with a
little stick so that the pulverized <m>charcoal</m> is well mixed in and
has not fallen to the bottom of the mixture. And in this way, throw it
in your mold bit by bit and not in one go, because <m>wax</m> is not
runny<cont/>

times until your mold is full. Now, concerning this mold of pulverized
<m>white plaster</m> &amp; reheated in the manner of the <m>sand</m>
from the preceding recipes, you should have made it long ago because it
is used many times. But, before using it, soak it for a good hour in
<m>cold water</m>, &amp; at a minimum, at least as long in <m>hot
water</m> that at first is so hot that you can't hold your finger in it.
And note that it absorbs no more, but that it appears very wet overall
without water seeping into it. In removing it closed from the <m>hot
water</m>, cast your <m>wax</m> in such a state of heat as has been
described. And neither the first nor the second casting will readily
come out well, hardly, until the mold is soaked. Let it cool down before
opening it so that the cast thing not break. You will know that the
casting is good when the <m>wax</m> coming back out of the mold is thin
and even. Remember to make several castings along the whole length of
the mold so that in this way the <m>wax</m> runs better.</ab>

casting, your work fills with bubbles and in so doing does not come out
neatly, it's all the same, because you have to face the fact that the
three or four first do not readily come out well. Firstly, you will know
whether there are a few barbs that keep it from stripping well. And you
will remove them if, on their own, they do not remove themselves in the
two or three first castings. And the more that you cast, the more you
will do it neatly. And your mold will serve you more than one hundred
times if it Is well governed. But it is good to soak it one night or one
day before casting so that it be well soaked. The same must be done for
fruits made from sugar. This <m>wax</m> is very soft &amp; friendly
&amp; pliant, like copper. And if it is hard <x>this is</x> because of
<m>sulfur</m>, which makes it melt more easily than than other
<x>wax</x>, so much that you can see evidence on a hot slate. And the
<m>sulfur</m> that you put inside will be found the second time that you
melt it, <x>as</x> cracks on the bottom. Having in this way passed
through <m>wax</m>, it will not catch fire at all when put to a candle.

If you want to cast any flat medal or any animal that is not very heavy,
and that must not be burnt inside the mold, you can indeed cast in mixed
<m>plaster</m> &amp; <m>brique</m>, as above; and not in <m>plaster</m>
alone, because it contracts too much feeling an ardent fire if it is not
so mixed. But, with the <m>brick</m>, it holds well. However, take heed
to dry out your mold at length &amp; on a slow fire &amp; with patience,
because there is no need to reheat it. But when your work is of
<m>flowers</m> or other things that want their mold to be reheated &amp;
set ablaze, mix the plaster with <m>stone alum</m> &amp; even with
<m>crocum</m>. I have molded in very neat <m>plaster</m> &amp;

<m>oiled</m> &amp; rubbed my medal with <m>spirits</m>. I made my
casting wide at the entrance, narrowing it as it goes along until it
reaches the medal which is very thin. I notched the casting which
embraced the medal well. I dried the mold out well on a slow fire &amp;
finally, I heated it well without turning it red. I let it cool in such
a way that I could hold my finger to it without burning myself. I made a
line of 4 ℥ of <m>tin</m>, &amp; ix deniers of <m>lead</m>. I cast it
red, and it was quite good and beautiful. Afterwards I put xii deniers

         <head>Casting a <al>crayfish</al>
         </head>

         <ab>The<al>crayfish</al> is one of the most fantastical to cast, but
also provides an example for casting other difficult things. You can
distinguish males and female by the eggs that the females carry, and by
the four little white back legs that males have in their tails after
behind main eight legs. It is good to dry them out a bit so that the
bumps come out more hard and beautiful, because none of what is made of
shell shrinks. It is true that should you dry the little inside legs for
too long, they become diminished and have no body. If they are too dry,
the flesh separates from the scales. Be sure then to maintain the mean.
They have certain hairs between the legs and at the end of the tail. And
because all hair is difficult to cast, because it gets mixed up in the
sand and does not release, you can burn it <sup>by putting</sup> a hot
iron on the <al>crayfish</al> so that it <sup>the hair</sup> cannot be
seen. As for animals that have hair or feathers, you must grease the
hair with <m>wheat oil</m>, which is very dry and which will make the
hair lay flat and straight. In this way, you will have form of your
animal and you will have the hair. Should it <sup>the hair</sup> be
wavy, it can be repaired. If your <al>crayfish</al> has eggs, which are
delicate, and which will be difficult to take out of the mold without
breaking, you would do better to make the first cast <sup> with the
crayfish</sup> on its belly and eggs. In this way, you will open the
mold with it <sup>the crayfish</sup> on its back, which will be hard and
easy to manipulate. And the belly and the eggs will remain in the mold.
And rather than opening your mold for the second time, you will have to
burn it with them in it. This way, it will open easily, and what has
been burned will come away cleanly. In this way, the second casting,
which is done on the first one that has successfully taken hold,
separates easily from the first, after having been refired. This is a
singular secret for similar moldings.</ab>

         <ab>Let your <al>crayfish</al> dry a little in the sun, by itself. If it
has spawns, they will shrink while drying, and be all the more beautiful
for it. Make your paste out of yellow <m>
               <pro>potter</pro>'s earth</m>,
just like for the other representations. Lay your <al>crayfish</al> on
it, the back side down, and the other parts which are more tricky to
mold -- legs, belly, eggs - side up. Drive in the back side in the
<m>clay</m> paste up to the legs, which is about the half part <sup>of
the crayfish's body</sup>. Fix the body with a pointy <m>iron</m> thread
in the middle and, if you feel you need it, you can also drive another
one at the edge of the tail. And in order that the big legs be lower
than the head, which is lower because it is linked from below, add a
little <m>clay</m> 
            <sup>under the head</sup>. Then add a bit of
<m>clay</m> under the jacket in order to raise it. Hide the feelers
under the <m>clay</m> and under the crusher claws, then arrange it as
you like. Stretch out the walking legs to the joints, and for the first
cast, bend the second part of the walking legs. Fix the joints of the
legs with <m>wax</m> and a warm <m>wire</m> so they will not move. If
you want to mould something fancier, fix the end of one walking legs on
the body or on a crusher claw , using the same <m>wax</m>. If the female
has spawns, bent half the tail over the spawns, and keep the shape by
fixing the tail with a <m>wire</m>. Be sure that you will be able to
clean this part. Finally rub your <al>crayfish</al> with <m>spirits</m>,
and cast your sand. Once the sand is hardened, uncover the back side,
the head, the eyes, and the small legs close to the crusher claws, and
the walking legs all along. One must uncover these parts as much as
possible. Then bend and cover the spawns again. The other animals</ab>

         <ab>are not so uncovered. But since <al>crayfish</al> are troublesome to
burn &amp; clean, you have to uncover them as much as you can, even the
little legs just until the tips, because they are troublesome &amp; if,
in order to not alter them, you have to take them out, you could break
something of the mold. Having uncovered it with the point of a knife,
like an engraving stick or another fitting thing, clean off the sand at
the joints &amp; elsewhere with your little brush really very
scrupulously. And if something is loosed from the <al>crayfish</al>,
attach it with <m>wax</m>, as is discussed. And also attach the horns
this way. And also do the casting the length of the extremes of the
little legs with <m>wax</m>. And refill the holes that have been made
with the needles of <m>iron</m> wire with it. And everything being quite
clean &amp; having uncovered more than half of it, <m>oil</m> your mold
after having soaked the back side in <m>water</m>, &amp; do not forget
to <m>oil</m> all the fine parts that are between the legs and the
little beaks; then rub the <al>crayfish</al> with <m>spirits</m>. And do
your second casting after having made the first mold even, so that the
cramp-irons join better. Your mold must be larger on the side with the
impression than on the back. Do not open your mold after the second
casting, so that it not become <m>clayed</m> &amp; reheated &amp; that
which is inside not be burned. Do not forget to mix <m>crocum</m>
throughout your sand when you mold the <al>crayfish</al>, because you
must really reheat it &amp; the <m>crocum</m> withstands this
marvelously. To mold a <al>crab</al> &amp; to mold a <al>crayfish</al>
are exactly the same. When you have uncovered your <al>crayfish</al> on
one side do not delay at all before doing the second casting, because
<al>crayfish</al> dry out. It is not enough to uncover the
<al>crayfish</al> such that you see the whole half <sup>the half you
uncover</sup>, but take heed that your mold, even when you are
uncovering, be good and stripped, because if the <al>crayfish</al> gets
well burnt, you will not be able to open your mold without breaking
it.</ab>

thickness to the reverse of your <m>paper</m> with melted <m>butter</m>,

take heed to apply this melted <m>butter</m> under the wing or in

other flowers, <m>butter</m> is not good, but rather <m>wheat oil</m>,

the <al>tortoises</al> have crooked ones. They eat a lot. To get ready
to kill them, open their mouth and pass a long penknife through all the
intestines. And then make it swallow some <m>vinegar</m> mixed with
<m>spirits</m> or <m>urine</m>, as one does for snakes. It is necessary
to mould them in several pieces, and even the back sometimes because the
sides of certain ones are narrower than others and in this instance do
not release <sup>from the cast</sup>. To make them die, you must not
boil them, because they come apart, even the shell, in the hot
<m>water</m>. They <sup>the shells</sup> come out better <sup>when</sup>
hollowed because their great thickness spoils the mold. <al>Turtles</al>
are more lively. The <al>tortoises</al> are leaner, slower, and more
sleepy. If you scratch <al>turtles</al> on their shells, no matter how
sleepy they are, they move; <al>tortoises</al> do not.</ab>

of metal, it is best to mold them hollow, since they turn out better.
You could make your cast in one great piece, but it would be troublesome
to cut. It is best to do it in three or 4 parts, which will be thicker
close to the animal, and include the most amount of edge that is close
to the cast/mold. Make as well some casting conduits all the way from

         <ab>Turtles are much more beautiful and easier to mould than tortoises,
being that they are flatter and have a longer head and tail, and
straighter legs and release better than tortoises, who are scraggly,
wrinkled, and deeply entrenched in their shells. They
<sup>tortoises</sup> also have a rounder top shell which is however
narrower on the sides than in the middle, which means that the top shell
cannot be nicely molded in one go, like those <sup>top shells</sup> of
turtles. Thus you will mould the top shell into two pieces, and the
lower shell into two, three, or four pieces according to their
appropriateness. If you want to release your turtle from the mold
without burning it, you must mold it in several pieces. But if you want
to burn what is inside, you can mold your top shell in one piece. So to
get started, once you have completely killed it in vinegar and urine, as
we know, leave it to fully dry out. And clean it well with a cloth. Then
take your clay base place it on it, and scrape the base a bit so that
the undershell fixes in. Having nevertheless previously arranged the
head with a strong needle, as you do with other animals, holding it high
by means of a bit of fresh clay that you will work with from beneath.
Stretch the aforesaid head and legs with your little pincers. Once the
head is in place, dextrously put a grain of yellow millet into each eye
with the pincers, because as soon as they die, the eyes pop out and rot.
You can do the same for any other animal with a large amaranth seed, a
small one, or a grain of rapeseed. This done, you will arrange the legs,
securing them with little iron needles. And then plug with clay the
holes all the empty spaces around the turtle, that is to say, what is in
between the two shells, so that the sand does not hinder the releasing
of it. And because the legs must be lower than the bottom shell, make a
little dimple in your clay base to accommodate them. Your turtle</ab>

         <ab>having been thusly arranged and well cleaned with brushes, put the
circle of <m>clay</m> around the base. Then, with a roll of <m>clay</m>
placed on the middle of the back of the <al>turtle</al>, as you can see,
and at the widest place, divide your mold. Next, <m>oil</m> with your
<m>oiling</m> brush half the half of the shell you want to mold. If you
sand is a bit thick, temper your sand with <m>warm water</m>, so that
without burning yourself you can put your finger in it without burning
it. And before casting it, rub the shell with <m>spirits</m>. And then
cast your sand and let it take hold. And note that all things that have
shells, or that are hard, or do not yield as <al>snakes</al> and
<al>lizards</al> do, must be <m>oiled</m> to come out cleanly. The
things that yield do not need this. <m>Warm water</m> means that the
tempered sand sits better on the <m>oil</m>, which otherwise would not
work. With the half <al>turtle</al> having been thusly molded, separate
it with its mold from its <m>clay</m> base, which you will put aside to
use when needed. Then clean your half-mold, join it and flatten it like
for the others. But because there will be the roll of <m>clay</m>, the
half mold will have more than just half the <al>turtle</al> in it, cut
and crop cleanly the excess <sup>clay</sup> and clean everything well
with the brushes. Then at the top of the edge of the mold on the side
where it is cut, at the halfway mark, make two notches as you have done
with other molds. And flip the <al>turtle</al> on its base, as it was,
and secure the two legs that are not molded with <m>iron</m> pins and
fill the empty areas around it, up to the edge of the top shell with
some <m>clay</m>. Then place the circle around it and place a roll of
<m>clay</m> on the first mold, a bit above the notches. And having
<m>oiled</m> the first half-mold and its notches and the shell of the

Having taken hold, keep the sides of the two molds neatly together, and
for each side secure the joints, which are not prone to do so naturally,
with two clamps, so that when you uncover the bottom of the
<al>turtle</al> the top joint does not open. Then open the side with the
belly and the throat, in the same manner that you would open a

that are molded in two parts.</ab>

            <m>Cuttlefish bone</m>
         </head>

         <ab>You must not heat the <m>tin</m> or <m>lead</m> too hot, otherwise
they will burn the <m>bone</m> and become lumpy. And to know when it is
the right temperature, dip in it a little piece of twisted <m>paper</m>.
If it turns black without catching fire, it is the right temperature.
But if it burns &amp; catches fire, it is too hot. You can cast
<m>gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m>, but it never comes out neatly. To cast
something delicate well, it is necessary that the <m>bone</m> not be
extremely dry, because it is rough &amp; does not release as well &amp;
crumbles &amp; is brittle. In any case, before you cast, dry them
<sup>the <m>bones</m>
            </sup> &amp; especially for <m>gold</m>, which does
not react well to humidity. You will know that they are dry enough when,
after having exposed the insides and the imprint to the fire, they hiss
&amp; crackle when you bring them near your ear. Now join the
<m>bone</m>s &amp; daub the joints with a little <m>lute</m> and slowly
dry it near the fire &amp; cast &amp; then shake the mold or scratch the
rough crannies and let it cool down before opening it. Usually one cuts
the <m>bone</m> in the middle, and the dull part that does not have half
circles <figure/> is more delicate and smoother to mold with, and
therefore one always uses it to do the main part of the casting, the
other <sup>part of the <m>cuttlefish bone</m>
            </sup> is crumbly on the
inside as on the outside. Therefore one does not use this to cast
delicate things which need to be molded in two places. One evens out
&amp; flattens these two halves on some piece of wood, then one rubs
some <m>charcoal</m> on top so that it releases well. And to make sure
the <m>charcoal</m> is evenly spread everywhere, tap the side of the
hand which is holding the half <m>bone</m>. Both having been covered in
<m>charcoal</m>, take the first <m>bone</m> that has been prepared &amp;
rounded on the edges, and having placed the medal above it, press the
medal down strongly.</ab>

         <ab>But with fingers you cannot press evenly, because if you press on
the edges, the middle will remain hollow. Start therefore with the
middle, &amp; then do the edges. But to do it better, put something flat
&amp; even on the medal, or some large square file, &amp; press with
that; because you will press evenly, sometimes with your knee, other
times with your foot with your shoe taken off. &amp; do it from above,
so that you impress it without breaking it. If it is not well molded on
the first go, do it again several times. Then restore and flatten your
halves of molded bone from the sides. And to cut them well, always start
from the most tractable part, coming out to the shell. And if your medal
does not come out on its own, scratch the rough bone from behind and it
will strip. When you want to cast, settle &amp; affix the two bones with
little pins of wood &amp; in order to cast neatly, you have only to try
it with sand.</ab>

         <ab>You do not need thin sheets of <m>clay</m>, because the herbs and
flowers will not lay on it, but as it were in the air, not touching
anything from any side, so you only have need of a circle &amp; contour
that is higher than for flat molds. And in this way, take heed to make
it strong and thick, with the heft that you find suitable. Otherwise, it
will sink in when the sand is inside. Fix &amp; fortify it well with
your foot &amp; firmly attach all the joints. Then, have your flower
well attached &amp; assuredly fixed to the bottom of the casting with
<m>wax</m> that is not at all rough, but smooth, so that it can strip
off well. Then moisten your flower or herb in good <m>spirits</m> in a
tall glass.</ab>

When you mold them, if they are not strong enough to hold themselves
upright, run a thread through the mold to keep them lest they do not
hoist themselves up. &amp; cast the sand little by little &amp;
continuously and blow on it strongly and constantly so that it covers
everywhere. Otherwise, it will become lumpy. Since you won't put
anything in thin sheets of <m>clay</m>, the mold sometimes sticks to the
table on which you mold. To release it, strike a great blow on the side
of the table with a hammer.</ab>

         <ab>so that it is wet everywhere. If not, wet it with a large brush
dedicated to this. Then pass the end of an <m>iron</m> wire that holds
the <m>wax</m> casting through the end of the mold that closes the
circle and have the <m>iron</m> cleave the <m>clay</m> mold as you see;
&amp; position it on the bottom, attending that the herb or flower does
not touch anything, and leave some thickness to your mold, because the
moistened sand always elevates the herb or flower. Even so, if it isn't
thick of its own accord, pass a slender thread through the flower with a
needle to keep it elevated. Or, if you forget this, lower the flower
with a little stick just until the cast sand starts to thicken. With
your flower well-positioned, take a platter large enough to moisten all
the sand that you will need to fill the mold. Put a little <m>sal
ammoniac water</m> in it, and then some <m>spring water</m>, and when
your platter is almost full, put a sprinkle of your sand on it, &amp;
mix it, &amp; steep it until it becomes totally uniform, because if it
were to clot it would consume the mold. For flowers it does not need to
be very thick. And likewise, at the beginning, when you just barely pour
it so it remains transparent on your flower &amp; covers it sort of half
way, blow strongly everywhere so that you eliminate the little bubbles,
and afterwards finish filling it &amp; blow, always slightly tilting
your mold down towards its larger side. And if you find some remainder
of thick sand that was not well soaked, set it rather close to the
casting than otherwise. Then you can cast some thicker moistened sand to
make it set sooner. I molded a marigold, with its leaves, in this
manner. <m>Crocum ferri</m> is safer for flowers, and when there is some
<m>crocum</m>, clay it with the same sand that has already been used and
is the most excellent of all.</ab>

The stem on which I cast a large branch of marigold with its flower, its

Uncover the molded flower while gently breaking the mold with the point
of a knife. And, even better, soak it well in <m>water</m>. Afterwards,
try a pig brush at the end of an <m>iron</m> wire, etc.</ab>

      <ab>
         <margin>left-middle</margin>

When the mold is reheated for the first time, leave it to cool down
halfway. Then, run an <m>iron</m> wire gentle through the casting to
make an opening for the burned ash inside. Afterwards, blow inside with
a bellows and turn the mold over on the casting to make everything
leave, &amp; sometimes blow and suck in with your mouth.</ab>

      <ab>
         <margin>left-bottom</margin>

Heed that you not attach the stem of the flower too firmly to the
casting with <m>wax</m>, lest it consume something when you remove the
<m>wax</m> from the casting. To remove it, you have to loosen it a bit
all around &amp; then draw it out by the <m>iron</m> wire with little
pincers.</ab>

         </head>

         <ab>This page is the continuation of the preceding second page.Since you
have cleanly uncovered the part of the belly of <al>turtle</al>, its
underparts, its throat, and its legs, and having cleaned it all well, do
not forget to neatly uncover the cavity that these animals have in their
shell between the neck and the shoulders. <al>Turtles</al> do not have
as deep of a cavity as <al>tortoises</al>, which are more scraggly, and
even amongst those, there are some that have a deeper cavity than
others. Do not therefore forget to neatly uncover all of this in order
to better represent its likeness. But if there is a cavity which spirals
too much inside, and is not visible, nor releases well, apply some small
lumps of <m>wax</m> and with heated needles of thick <m>iron</m> and
work the aforesaid <m>wax</m>. Then plug the entrance to all of these
cavities with <m>soft clay</m>. Put the circle of <m>clay</m> around the
mold, which has already been made of two pieces and contains the back of
the <al>turtle</al>. And to mold its belly, you must separate it in
three as you can see. That is to say, you will put a roll of <m>clay</m>
on top of the throat and another one on the edge of the shell of its
tail, so that only the shell of the entire stomach will be accessible to
be molded on its own. Having <m>oiled</m> the shell of the belly and
having rubbed it with <m>spirits</m>, thrown you slightly thick sand,
which has been tempered with <m>hot water</m> as before. Having taken
hold, remove the rolls of <m>clay</m>, then uncover the front and back
legs, that is to say the bottom bit, and the throat and the tail, and
remove the clay of all the cavities in one go if you can, because this
will show you if the cavity will release well. And if the removed
<m>clay</m> carries with it some of the <m>wax</m> you have applied, put
it back into the places that did not release well, as has been said. And
if some bit of the <al>turtle</al> has come away with the <m>clay</m>,
or fallen off, attach and rejoin it to the mold with some <m>wax</m>,
using a heated <m>iron</m> needle. Do not forget to put some melted
<m>wax</m> at the edge of the <al>turtle</al>'s nails when you cast.
Having molded and uncovered the shell of the belly, you will see the
mold in this way.<figure>#</figure>

         <ab>Be warned to make an edge of <m>wax</m> melted with a warm
<m>wire</m> all around the edge of the top shell which is close to the
tail in order to make a better cast. And make it so that two small
strings of the same <m>wax</m> goes from the end of the shell of the
belly to the aforesaid <m>wax</m> edge, which is around the backbone of
the shell, and the <al>turtle</al>'s tail should stay in between those
two strings. This to make a better cast. This done, <m>oil</m> your mold
and what you can see of the shell. Put the circle around this, and cast
with <m>hot water</m> as before, and doing what you have done in the
same manner to mold the third part which is the tail. And having taken
hold, take away the <m>clay</m> contours, clean your mold, bring it
together, and flatten it on all sides with a knife as you have done with
other molds. Lightly dip it in <m>water</m>, then try to release it.
Usually, one starts by the shell of the back, which is to say the top
mold that is made of two halves. And this one is easier to release. The
other follows directly after, but because it is next to the
<al>turtle</al>'s shoulders which are deeply entrenched, it is sometimes
troublesome to do this when lightly shaking and pulling the mold. Be
advised to pull the easiest one first, because you will need to release
them one after the other. The hardest one of all is the one molding the
throat, the underside of the legs, and the cavities of the shoulders,
which are so difficult to release, that if you do not plan accordingly
by filling it with wax rather than molding what cannot been released, it
will be difficult to take the pieces without breaking something. But if
it happens to you again, there is a solution, provided that you keep the
broken pieces, because you can reassemble them with stong iron needles,
and fill whatever crack or flaw you have with some melted wax and hot
iron as you have with others so that the noyau to mold hollow is easier
to do. After</ab>

         <head>Molding <al>turtles</al>
         </head>

         <ab>Join the parts of your mold and fix very carefully clamps on all
joints, which are on the top, the bottom and the sides of the mold; do
not forget to notch the joints as you did with the other moulds. Once
you have fixed all the clamps, remove the sides ones, not the others.
Thus your mold, made of several pieces, will open as if it was only made
of two parts. If you want to mould hollow, pierce a hole big enough to
thread the end of your little finger in the middle of your mold's belly.
Widen the outside of the hole, like clervois, in order to cast the core.
You could avoid all these difficulties if you didn't mold hollow; you
could then mold your <al>turtle</al> in two pieces, more quickly, and
burn it inside of the mold like other animals. But a <al>turtle</al> is
weighty, and would be heavy if not molded hollow. This is why it is
considered better to mold it that way. It takes three days to make the
proper <sup>hollow</sup> mould. To mold hollow and fantastic
<sup>forms</sup>, you need very strong <m>plaster</m> which can
withstand fire without bursting. But if you can't get this kind of
<m>plaster</m>, add to it a little more <m>stone alum</m>, and also add
<m>crocum</m>, which fortifies it <sup>the <m>plaster</m>
            </sup> and
makes the flaws -- if there are any -- so fine that they can be easily
removed. Do not forget to tighten your mould with a press in order to
avoid flaws that happen when your mold is not tight enough, or when it
bursts. To repair it, if the lines are not apparent enough retrace with
a burin, then soften the lines with a ciselet. You can remove the flaws
with a chaple, a kind of burin. For the lumps and crumbly bits, they can
be made with a gadet or a small carving tool which isn't hammered, and
hitting with a small file.</ab>

         <ab>Large <al>flies</al> can be molded &amp; cast. But you must apply
underneath their wings some <m>wheat oil</m>, which dries quickly and
firms them up &amp; gives them a little thickness. The same thing can be
done with <al>butterflies</al>, <al>cicadas</al>, <al>grasshoppers</al>
&amp; similar things. But to cast them more easily, you must set them on
some leaf or bouquet. The others should be placed by hand on a very
slender <m>silver</m> blade. You cannot keep your insects when they are
dead, since they will dry out and their legs will break.</ab>

            <margin>left-bottom</margin>

            <m>Wheat oil</m> should be put underneath delicate things to make them

         <head>Moulds</head>

         <ab>They are less prone to cracking while reheating when they are very
thick, rather than thin, provided that thickness is sufficient. Because
when they are thin, they do not need to be fired for long, and prolonged
exposure to heat corrupts them. The same thing will happen if you
<m>plaster</m> is not strong.</ab>

         <ab>It is better to reheat one mold on its own, rather than heating it
with others, because should this be the case, you will need a stronger
and hotter fire, than for just the one <sup>mold</sup>. And because
<m>charcoal</m> will accumulate between multiple molds, the heat will
transfer from mold to mold in such a way that you will often find that
your molds have burst and crack on one side more than the other.</ab>

         <ab>Therefore reheat your molds, not applying fire, except to cover
it.</ab>

         <ab>And because your <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m> become brittle when
melting the over high heat, in order to make them less brittle, heat
them over low heat, and cast in stick form.</ab>

         <head>Molding hollow</head>

         <ab>This <m>iron</m> thread needle which you put thusly in the mold, is
to better secure the noyau and keep it from shifting. All of this having
been thusly arranged, lay your mold on the table, hole facing upwards,
as it is explained at the side. And then fashion a circle made of soft
<m>clay</m>, of about two fingers high around the hole, as you have done
with other molds. And then temper your molding sand to an average
thickness, and throw it in the hole until it <sup>mold</sup> is very
very full, that is to say until you reach the <m>clay</m> circle. Be
advised not to throw it <sup>sand</sup> in the middle of the hole, but
from the sides, because the already made mold, will drink and suck the
moisture. And the new sand that you throw on the sides of the mold,
because drying quickly, will plug the mold and not <sup>leave you enough
time</sup> to fill up. Whereas if you throw it <sup>the sand</sup> from
the side, when you realize <sup>it is drying too quickly</sup> and plugs
up, you can make a path for it. Having thrown it in, blow on the
tempered sand, and insert the tip of your finger in the hole a few
times, or some kind of pointy thing to keep it moist, in order to make
sure that the hollow <m>wax</m> does not fill up. At the end throw in
the thicker tempered sand to strengthen the mold, because when
<m>water</m> rises up to the edge of the mold, it always makes it
softer. Having taken hold, get rid of the <m>clay</m> circle and any
raised parts that relate to the hole through which you threw the noyau,
and you will not even realize the process took place. Once your mold has
been thusly prepared, lute its outside with the same sand that you used
to make the mold. Then reheat it on with a low heat to begin with, slant
the mouth of the cast downwards so that the <m>wax</m> trickles out
slowly, because if you reheat it over very high heat to make the
<m>wax</m> come out, it will boil inside it <sup>the mold</sup>, and
will leave blisters and lumpy bits on it <sup>the cast</sup>, as long
as</ab>

            <margin>left-top</margin>

This <m>iron</m> thread needle is placed in the middle and the hole of
the cast, when the mold is in many pieces, as is the one for
<al>turtles</al>. And you do this so that the noyau does not shift. But
when the mold is made out of only two pieces, it is not necessary to put
needles in the middle.

         <ab>the <m>white wax</m> you have used to make <m>black sulfured wax</m>
has so little substance, being dry and purified, that it leaves nothing
with it <sup>the mold mentioned in the first part of this recipe</sup>
and trickles very gently. As for the <m>coal</m> which is mixed in it,
if there is some left, it burns and reduces to ash, and can be taken out
afterwards by blowing into the cast. You can open your mold after the
<m>wax</m> has been melted, if it does not contain a fantastical piece
which could break, which are like pieces added on or similar. After
having covered the clamps with <m>lute</m> from your sand, and having
covered the entire mold, add to this a layer of common <m>luth</m>, and
then sprinkle ground <m>brick</m> so that you can better manipulate it.
Leave the <m>lute</m> to dry slowly, rather than putting it in the fire,
which will melt the <m>wax</m>. The <m>wax</m>, having exited the cast,
that which remains of it, mixed up with the <m>charcoal</m>, will burn.
Having reheated it for the first time, <m>lute</m> it again, because
should your <m>plaster</m> be bad, it will have eaten away at the mold
and it will be found in the space between joints, which can result in
large overflow. And for the second time, you must not reheat it if you
want to cast only in <m>lead</m> or in <m>tin</m>, simply make sure that
the <m>lute</m> is very dry and your mold attains an average heat. For
those very large <al>turtles</al> that have enough thickness, it is
better to cast using an alloy of half <m>tin</m> and half <m>lead</m>,
as you do with hollow things. Because if you only need to cast very thin
and fragile things like flowers, rely instead on using more <m>lead</m>
than <m>tin</m>, which bubbles when cast a bit thickly and will easily
some flaws to your cast. Master Alexander says he has never gone astray
with using half <m>tin</m> and half <m>lead</m> for things that are
heavy and as thick as the back of a knife. If there is <m>crocum</m>,
you will not be able to clearly see the joints and as a consequence the
metal overflow is very small and thin. You can repair this, and through
the hole of the belly draw out the earth from the noyau, leaving it to
soak for a long time.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-top</margin>When you have thrown your <m>black wax</m>
in the mold and it has well-cooled, you will have to open half of your
mold to make your cast. Should your <m>black wax</m> figure break, there
is no danger, because it can always be reattached with a hot <m>iron</m>
needle. Or if the pieces have not separated well from their mold, they
will meet up and join as before, by joining and tightening the two
halves of the mold. When your figure is big, you must interweave more
<m>iron</m> threads inside to give support to the noyau.

as much as if you were about to burn an animal inside, so that the
<m>wax</m> melts well and leaves nothing inside, and trickles out while
holding the mold slanted towards the cast and at the same time reheating
it. And when the mold has been reheated, leave it to cool slowly, then

         <ab>However, do not remove it before you have prepared the whole
<al>turtle</al>, because you will use this <m>earth</m> as
<m>cement</m>, should you need embed something or make repairs with a
chisel. If you have some metal overflow at the joints of your mold, you
will remove it, either with a burin, called a chaple, or with a very
sharp pen-knife, or with a small file followed by the chisel. Always
keeping in front of you the real thing to do as best you can. You can
curl on a file a chisel point, which is not at all moistened, to make
something lumpy. For these <al>turtles</al> and any other hollow things
which you can assume are quite big, create a <m>ligue</m> of half
<m>lead</m> and half <m>refined tin</m>. There is more to do when
molding a <al>turtle</al> than when molding a dozen flowers. If there is
<m>crocum</m> in your sand, there will be no metal overflow and if you
are unfortunate enough that there should be some on the sides, these
will be as thin as <m>paper</m>, as long as your mold is very tightly
pressed together. And to make the scales of <al>turtles</al> and other
animals, you can make little chisel marks in the shape of round punch
cutters, others in the shape of a gouge, or shaped like a <al>snake</al>
or <al>lizard</al> scale, and other using a file used to make twisty
bits and lumps. <al>Turtles</al> that do not need to be molded hollow
are not as much work, because they are molded in two pieces and repair
them with little chisels <sup>that make</sup> punch cutters, little
couge, and serrated chisels.

         <head>Molding a <al>rat</al>
         </head>

         <ab>The hairs of his whiskers are difficult to come out of the mold, you
can therefore shave them with fire, as did the tyrant of
<pl>Syracuse</pl>, which you can always replace with life-like
<m>silver</m> ones. The tail comes out beautifully because it is made of
little scale-like circles, almost like the ones of a <al>lizard</al>.
And to make sure that the hair does not keep you from molding well, burn
them away with a little candle. The rest of the body must be oiled with
<m>wheat oil</m>, which will keep the hair rigid and flat, so that it
will not be removed when it mixes with the sand, which will keep you
cast from releasing cleanly. <m>Wheat oil</m>, being dry, will dry
quickly, you will therefore be able to comb the hair with a very fine
comb, so that the hair will be visible when cast. On a small
<al>mouse</al> you can use <m>common oil</m> to flatten the hair. Rather
than molding these animals immediately (except for <al>snakes</al> and
<al>lizards</al>), keep them dead for a day a two so that they become
easier to handle. Because they are very stiff after they die and cannot
be shaped into a life-like looking position unless they are softened.
However, if you mold it straight after it dies, and give it its shape
before it becomes stiff, that will be good. And because the eyes die
unless you mold them immediately, you can replace them with half a round
<m>pea</m> taken out of its shell. Some cast their <al>rats</al> without
any added preparations; others oil them with <m>olive oil</m> which
suits the purpose, because <m>wheat oil</m> is thick and has too much
body. This is why we only use it <sup>wheat oil</sup> in light strokes
on <m>fly</m>'s feet or beneath a wing, to keep them stiff. Others
flatten the hair with an <m>egg yolk</m>, which dries quickly and does
the job. Arrange it <sup>the <al>rat</al>
            </sup> on its <m>clay</m> base
before oiling it. Raise its head with an <m>iron</m> needle, and also
secure its feet with needles, and it tail. Rub it with <m>spirits</m>
after the <m>oil</m> has dried. Then throw in your sand. Uncover it as
you would other animals, then do your second casting. You must not open
the mold until it is completely reheated and the <al>rat</al> has burned
away.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-top</margin>
            <figure>+</figure>If it is a big
<al>rat</al>, it is better to cast it hollow, because it is thick. A
<al>mouse</al> is easier to mold because it has shorter hair. It is
impossible to mold an animal with big bones well, such as a bird or
<al>rat</al>, without opening the mold to clean it well, because bones
do not burn well.</ab>

            <margin>left-middle</margin>All kinds of feathers and hairs are
difficult to mold realistically.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-middle</margin>It is better to use <m>butter</m> to
grease hairy animals than <m>wheat oil</m>, because it is better suited
to the purpose.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-bottom</margin>If the <al>rat</al> is big, it is better
to remove its entrails, or having molded it, let it dry in an oven,
because the large amount of moisture it contains would boil inside the
mold, which would ruin it and make it lumpy.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-bottom</margin>Only put your mold in the oven after it
has cooled, drying slowly, otherwise it will absorb the moisture and
break.</ab>

         <head>Repairing things that have been cast</head>

         <ab>

It happens often that what you have cast has metal overflow, through a
fault in the mold, the cast, or the <m>metal</m>. Faults in the mold
arise from <m>plaster</m> which is not hard and strong and cannot
withstand fire, which is corrected by mixing in <m>crocum</m>. If you
use too much <m>tin</m> to cast things that are of an average thickness,
it will not release well, because tin that is cast thickly, shrinks and
bubbles. Similarly, the things you need to mold hollow can be
fantastical to cast. If therefore you happen to have a flaw, have at
your disposal a small <m>leather</m> pouch full of fine sand, and having
placed it on the edge of a <pro>goldsmith</pro>'s bench, where one
files, place upon it your work, and secure it there with a rope which
passes underneath your foot. The sand in your pouch will respond <sup>to
the pressure of your foot</sup>, and will immediately be thicker on one
side and thinner on the other. Then immediately with a burin, outline
and quickly make the subtle parts of your cast which did not come out,
or which did not come out distinctly enough, or with a file or a chaple,
remove your <m>metal</m> overflow. If there is a flaw in your materials
that has left a hole or something too hollow, scrape it with a burin and
make notches around that hole, then make an imprint of this with
<m>wax</m>. And place this imprint on a fine <m>lead</m> blade, and in
this way mark the appropriate size of <m>lead</m>, or of any other alloy
which resembles your casting material the most. Then place this piece of
work on the notched part and attach it well with some with <m>yellow
latten</m> or <m>copper</m> wire - and if you are dealing with
<m>tin</m> or <m>lead</m> rub in some <m>rosin</m> around the edge - and
apply all around it <sup>the replacement piece</sup> some little thin
pieces of <m>solder</m> or <m>tin</m>, or any other thing. Then with a
hot <m>iron</m>, or above the heat source of the forge, solder it
together, and then repair all of this with the aforesaid tools and the
appropriate chisels.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-top</margin>

For <m>gold</m> or a small work, you will need to attach them to a
<m>lead</m> ball, which you will then place on the <m>leather</m> pouch
and it will help secure the piece with the rope.</ab>

         <head>Moulding the hollow part of a mold for seals or other
things</head>

         <ab>Firstly fashion your figure in <m>wax</m> on an even slab of
<m>glass</m> or <m>slate</m>. After, mold it with our aforesaid sand,
having beforehand lightly smeared with <m>oil</m> as you know, and
having rubbed it with <m>spirits</m>, while tempering your sand with
<m>hot water</m>. Having made the hollow part, cast it in <m>lead</m>,
using the same alloy as you do for other figures that come out very
neatly. However, if it does not release cleanly, repair it. And then
mold with <m>wax</m> on the <m>lead</m> relief &amp; you will have a
very neat cavity in the <m>wax</m> that comes out very neat in
<m>lead</m>. After, in your <m>wax</m> hollow part, throw in your
tempered sand which will give you a relief, upon which you will cast
your hollow part with <m>silver</m>, or any other metal used for seals.
But note that you must not make your hollow part with melted <m>wax</m>,
but only with <m>wax</m> warmed in hot <m>water</m>, or even better in
hot <m>urine</m>. Or else, if you have a relief in <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m>, or any other very neat and flawless metal, mold your
<m>wax</m> hollow part directly upon it, and throw your sand in it
<sup>wax hollow</sup>, which will form your relief, upon which you will
cast your hollow part to make your seal or any other work. You could
also cast a hollow part directly from the main part of your metal, even
<sup>should you want to cast</sup> in <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>, which
will not make the main part of your metal melt, if it has been lightly
brushed with <m>crushed chalk</m>, or covered with <m>candle soot</m>,
or with dried <m>glair of egg</m>.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-top</margin>When you have the <m>wax</m> imprint of
your seal, mold in a noyau this piece of <m>wax</m>, which is hollow
like your seal, and your noyau will make a mold similar to the imprint
and the seal.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-middle</margin>Your <m>wax</m> must be mixed with a
color that has little body, so that you may better see your imprint. The
<m>lamp black</m> or <m>soot black</m> is good for this. <m>White
wax</m> to do this is even better.</ab>

            <m>flour</m>. And to flatten it, take a small stick of <m>wood</m>
that is round and of an even thickness, which has at both ends a small
circle that sticks out from the rest, in order to give the necessary
thickness to your <m>paste</m>. And then with this rolling pin, flatten
it so that it becomes thin and tenuous. Then apply it on the hollow part
of your mold and press it down with <m>cotton</m>, and your figure will
impress itself on the paste, in relief on one side, and hollow on the
other. This done, with a brush that is dipped in melted <m>butter</m>,
grease the part of the <m>paste</m> that is hollow. Then trim off the
extra <m>paste</m> which extends beyond the hollow of the mold. Also
<m>oil</m> your mold with <m>olive oil</m>, as you have done with
others. Apply your <m>clay</m> contour, and cast your second mold. And
you will have a medal as thin and hollow on one side as you wish. You
can have various rolling pins which some edges are more raised than
others, in order to make various thicknesses, or you can use sheets
<m>lead</m> and <m>copper</m> of various thicknesses, or
<m>cardboard</m>, all cut with the rolling pin.</ab>

         <head>Moulding a rose</head>

         <ab>Because of the little branches of the rose bush, which are around
the flower, are sometimes very spread out, they would demand too big of
a mold. We make and cast them separately, the rose and the rosebuds
separately as well. And then one brings them together, soldering the
little branches and leaves of the rose bush to the stem of the rose, on
which you will have purposefully left bits of the small branches. Put
your petal or rose as low as you can in your mould, because <m>sand</m>
will always bring it up or raise it. You can also mould several petals
together, arranged one on top of the other, separating them some thread.
And for the look of the rose you can give a thin layer of <m>melted
butter</m> on the back of the petals, but only on the outside petals,
not the inside petals, to stiffen them and give them the strength to
withstand, so that the wet sand does not stretch or spread them out more
than necessary. You can also mold well the leaves of a rosebush,
strawberry plant and similar things, that are flat and can be flattened
without being spoiled. For two castings, to open your mould, when it has
been reheated and then clean the ashes out, make some vents, and <x>you
will be able to do</x> several casts. This is the easiest way and you
can also do the other. And with little veins of <m>wax</m> that has been
adapted and joined from leaf to leaf, you can make casts. You can even
make a little vein of <m>wax</m> from the back of the first petal, which
will join up with the main cast. All of this will facilitate the casting
process. The main thing is to let your reheated moulds cool down rather
than cleaning them and blowing inside them to make the wax come out,
because when the mold is hot, the ash almost attaches itself to it. But
when it is cold it, it detaches and leaves with air draft or when one
draw in one's breath through the small opening. </ab>

I would be of the opinion to mold the rose on its own with a bit of its
stem close to its bud, and then to join the rose to a longer one <x>a
stem</x> made of <m>glazed brass</m>, because the rose bloom is very big
and heavy.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>bottom</margin>
Moisten your rose with <m>spirits</m> before placing it in the clay. Do
not forget to oil the <m>wax</m> cast. And when you have thrown in your
<m>wet sand</m>, blow heavily, until it begins to set. The rose came out
well. But because the <m>sand</m> was mixed within the petals, soak your
work in water for a long time so that when you shake it in the water,
the earth comes off.</ab>

         <head>Rose</head>

         <ab>Because the rose bloom is rather wavy, and its petals are all mixed
up and arranged in various ways, it will not be beautiful if it is not
painted, and you must also consider that its weight cannot supported by
the <m>tin</m> stem which is sour and fine. One moulds the flower of the
rose in a separate mould, casting it thickly so that it comes out more
easily. Then one cuts the cast at the edges of the stem of the bud, in
which you graft and solder a stalk of brass wire to which you also
solder the leaves. But because this <m>tin</m>, being so thin, is hard
to solder, and may melt some of the leaves and also the cast flowers;
<x>you should consider</x> that cast flowers, especially roses, are not
beautiful without being painted, so one does not make the effort to
solder them, but <x>instead</x> one grafts the pieces that you want to
join together and glues them with <m>fish glue</m> that has been a
little moistened and melted until thick. And so that it takes better,
you heat the work in <m>tin</m> lightly and for a long time, because if
it is cold, the <m>glue</m> will not take. Once your flower is thusly
repaired, you follow the joints of the added parts with some
<m>esbaucher wax</m>, which is a white <m>wax</m> mixed with much
well-ground <m>ceruse,</m> or even better, <m>white lead,</m> melting it
and placing it on your work with a small warm bit of <m>iron</m> needle.
In the same way you can repair the little filaments that are in the
middle of the rose, or the holes that may appear in some of the petals.
Then paint your rose realistically. If you cast your rose in <m>gold</m>
or <m>silver</m>, you can also rejoin <x>parts</x> and solder its. And
in those materials, when you have join something very delicate together
with the flower, such as a fly or other similar things, <m>fish glue</m>
is excellent, and holds very well, fixing it with a few little needles
that act as nails. The leaves and buds can be cast in two molds that can
be opened once they have been reheated, but not before. Then these
things join up <x>with the flower</x>.</ab>

you will cast your wax relief. And then on this <m>wax</m>, you will

make this process go faster, if you are in a hurry, make the first

         <ab>Cast a lizard or any medal you would like in <m>silver</m>, of low

dried up in the fire, burnish it, brush it with a wirebrush. Apply
another layer of light gilding, repeating the whole process. Do this
three or four times or even more depending on how thick you want your
<m>gold</m> to be. Then, in the most discrete place you can find, make a
small opening, and submerge your entire work in some good <m>aqua
fortis,</m> which will penetrate into the <m>silver</m> through the
opening and will corrode the <m>silver</m> without damaging the
<m>gold</m>. In this way, you will have a lizard that is hollow until
the tip of its nails or any type of work that is so light that when you
blow into it, it moves. But be advised not to apply a thick layer of
<m>amalgamated gold</m> in one go, or apply layers that are too thin
each time, because this will block the finer details, but if you proceed
as I have said, <x>i.e.</x> lightly and in many goes, and cleaning it

         <head>Moulding a fly</head>

         <ab>Take the fattest flies, that go to pantries, which are not hairy, if
at all possible. If they are hairy, oil lightly their fur and their
unmanageable hairs with olive oil to make them lie flat. Take them also
and use them as quickly as you can after they have died, because it you
leave them to dry out, their legs will break when you want to stretch
them. You must also, to get a better cast, arrange them on some kind of
leaf or other similar thing. This will help to cast their little legs,
that are so fragile that unaided, they will not cast easily. They can be
arranged on a sage leaf or something similar. They cast well in gold or
silver but one usually the legs and wings separately and then join them
<x>to the main body.</x> I have cast one on a bouquet of sage that had
seven or eight leaves. And to arrange it, I affixed the legs on the
largest leaf with a bit of melted wax and joined them with the pointed
tip of a hot iron wire. And to make sure that the wings will
<x>eventually</x> join more easily <x>to the body</x>, I applied on the
underside some melted butter with a small brush. And with same pointed
end of a warm iron wire I applied wheatgerm oil on the legs and feet. To
tame and bed the downy hair that it has I also apply a bit of olive oil.
</ab>

         <ab>I do not let wheatgerm oil dry out a lot because it is very thick
and has body, and the spirits cannot penetrate it.</ab>

         <ab>For applications, tallow is too harsh, pork fat is too soft, and but
is excellent because it is rather dry and curdles and instantly melts
and is firmer. Be advised that the legs and feet are well set on the
leaf, and not go beyond the leaf, because the whatever exceeds the leaf
will not cast as well, even if cast in silver, because these parts are
so fine that they will not cast. And truthfully, feet set on a leaf,
cast well, but those set from leaf to leaf which remain iffy did not
come out well in tin. The rest of the fly was cast, and likewise the
sage bouquet which cast very beautifully.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-top</margin>
You could also cast them well in gold or silver without the feet, and
without attaching to a flower by casting it underneath the belly and
then joining the feet with soldering. And if you need to, cast the wings
in the same metal and it could be enameled if you fortify the wings and
feet as previously said.</ab>

         <ab>
            <margin>left-top</margin>
If your sage leaf or your branch needs to be repaired, do as I have said
below. And then paint in a realistic way.

It is necessary to cast the fly from the ass with some melted wax,
fitted by an iron tip, as you know, to which the fly attaches itself,
and then the wax, as it melts, serves as a cast for the fly.

If it happens that you have some defects with your fly's wings, hammer
some very fine tin, or gold or silver, if you cast it, and shape with
scissors the amount you need for your wings. And then apply it with
tweezers and glue it with fish glue, applied like it is shown below. And
before doing thing this heat your work lightly so that its coldness does
not repel the glue, which will dry quickly, heating it from afar. Then
cover lightly the joints of whatever you've attached to the cast with
some esbaucher wax, which is a white wax that is mixed with a lot of
ceruse or white lead, melting it with a warm iron point. You will also
cut little bits of harpsicord string and will glue them with the
aforementioned glue when they are dry. It is to know, the feet, having
been reworked thusly, you will make them bigger with this same melted
wax so that they are equal in proportion <x>with the rest</x>.</ab>

bones, they put a piece of <m>paper</m> between the two bones &amp; join
the bones and cast. The work comes in parts by halves. And then with a

them.</ab>

         <ab>

Take heed that your mold be quite cold when you blow in order to get the
<m>ashes</m> out. And afterwards put in <m>☿</m> in order to finish the
cleaning. Because if the mold is hot, the <m>☿</m> will go inside &amp;
seek out the conduits in escaping, &amp; will leave its own odor, which
will aggravate the <m>tin</m> or other <m>metal</m> that you will cast,
such that it will break in touching the mold at all. The heat of the
mold also retains some little grains of <m>☿</m> that will make lumps
&amp; stick to the sides of the molded leaves and attach to them &amp;
make them frangible. The <m>☿</m> cleans ashes well. Likewise flat
things where there are not delicate traces that it could break with its
weight. And therefore, if you can cast neatly without putting it in,
don't use it at all. But if you have need of it, mix your <m>crocum
sand</m> so that it withstands fire well. And after having put in the
<m>☿</m>, evacuate it, bouncing the end of the mold from below while
moving it. Afterwards reheat your mold gently so that the <m>☿</m> is
gone from everywhere. In this way I cast a branch of periwinkle leaves
&amp; flowers very neatly. Having put a branch of melted <ill/> in the
flower, on the back of the flower <ill/>.</ab>

discussed, that is to say cast the flowers in one mold, and the leaves
in two parts in order to solder them onto the flower, this is the better

closed mold. I tried one which came out well from the mold. But the

will be equally reheated. You can open this kind of mold in order to
clean it, when you mold some animals, like crayfish, which burn. When

         <ab>If you reheat <m>plaster</m> as a stone it would crumble into
<m>water</m>, but if you grind it before reheating it, it will not
crumble into <m>water</m>, on the contrary it will harden in water, if
it is good plaster like the one from Paris or from Spain which is as
hard as a stone, and which is found through poor and dry earths, and
which looks like white <m>salt</m>. German people use this
<m>plaster</m> to make statues for their fountains, even if the statues
are varnished they will not be damaged with <m>water</m>. On the
contrary harden this plaster with <m>water</m>. When this <m>sand</m> is
unmixed it sets much sooner. Oil very lightly your shapes of metal or of
other materials otherwise you will not be able to strip <m>plaster</m>
from the mold. And dip your mold into hot <m>water</m> in order to open
it, if it does not open in hot <m>water</m>, it could open into boiling
<m>water</m>.</ab>

left-over pieces of your mould, and break them up on a long table with a
big metal block until they are very well crushed. And for an even better
result, sieve them neatly. Place them in the oven pots of
<pro>tile-makers,</pro> in a bread oven, <x>firing them</x> several
times, when it is well heated so that they become very red. When cooled
down, rebreak them if you need to and sieve them. After, put them in a
vaisse, a semal or a vessel that is appropriate and clean. And then wet
it with clear <m>water.</m> And crush it and mix it with a big stick
until it is very well-moistened and rinsed, and the dirty parts rise to
the surface of the water. Keep stirring in this way the dulled
<m>gip</m>, that one prepares to gilt burnished <m>gold</m> over five or
six days, until it is in no way lumpy. And each time your stir it, leave
it to rest and cull the clear <m>water</m> that will be on the top by
tipping the pot, or with a porringer, or with a sponge. And put in some
new clean <m>water</m> and in this way wash and stir until it is refined
and purged of all filth. Then leave to drain a little bit and to dry and
make of it some balls, soaked in <m>sal ammoniac</m>. Having been thus
dried, put them to be recooked in very high heat in a reverberatory
furnace for a good amount of time, where they will become very red.
Having been recooked in this way, crush them and try to mold something
in a box mold, having moistened your crushed powder with <m>water of sal
ammoniac</m>. And reheat and redden you box mold, and if your
<m>sand</m> comes away, then you must crush it again and moisten it
again with <m>water of sal ammoniac</m>. Remold it in two balls and
recook it and redden it and continue this for as many times as necessary
until it does not come away from the box mold when the box mold is
reddened. The main thing is for it to be well recooked, because
otherwise the <m>sal ammoniac</m> will not calcinate well and will make
the <m>sand</m> coarse. And for this reason, you should not put in too
much <m>sal ammoniac</m>.</ab>

         <head>Molds of things which have not been<lb/>

         <ab>Animals who have not been skinned can only be molded in a double
mold, which can only be opened after they have been refired and after
the enclosed animal is completely burnt. Animals with bones or scales
which are not reducible to powder thus remain in calcined pieces which
will never removed from the cast, however much bellowing or whatever
amount of quicksilver is put in, or by using a feather pipe while
molding to make a gate. This is why you mold in two halves: so that once
the mold is opened after having been refired, the thing you've burnt can
be cleaned out. But I advise letting it cool so that in taking off the
clamps (being hot) nothing cracks while it is still fragile. While it is
hot the crust and cinders which it leaves and which stick to the mold
can be more easily removed when it is cold. Also note that on the side
of the lower mold when you reheat the animal, which in boiling leaves a
crust, in this case, always mark on the mold where the back of the
animal is so that in reheating it is to the top and above and will by
this method stay cleaner.</ab>

         <ab>To save using <m>amber</m>, <pro>perfume-makers</pro> readily add
add a small quantity of <m>musk</m> to the white layers, in order to get

they add a bit of <m>starch</m> from <pl>England</pl>, which is
perfectly white.</ab>

         <ab>To give off a scent of <m>white amber</m>, in the same way that the
<pl>Portuguese</pl> do, take a chunk of <m>amber</m> that you have
broken up into pieces. Having put in a small <m>silver</m> porringer a
spoon of <m>flower oil</m>, should you not have some, <m>linseed
oil</m>. That is to say, use the type of <m>silver</m> spoon one might
use at the table. Pour into this your <m>ambergris</m>, then place it on
a low fire, it will melt quickly if your <m>amber</m> is of good
quality, and there will be no lumps. Having melted it all, put in a
small bit of <m>civet</m>, and melt it all and blend it well together.
Then take your gloves which you have cleaned and dried properly, and
lightly dip the edge of your finger around the edge of the <m>oil</m>,
with patience slowly spread the <m>oil</m> along the glove, and rub the
glove between your hands and trace along the fingers and its stitches,
one after the other. Leave it to dry. Then repeat the previous procedure

acquires a deeper color and almost like crushed <m>aes ustum</m> or like

red color like <m>cinnabar</m> when placed in <m>spirits</m>. And the
one and the other, when prepared as said above, finely ground and made
very hot, produce a red smoke like an acid vapor if, being thus hot and
fine, one throws <m>vinegar</m>, <m>urine</m> or <m>spirits</m> on top.
The <m>urine</m> makes a lot of color and the <m>spirits</m> as
well.</ab>

         <ab>It is much better to only lightly repair your work with a burin
called an <fr>onglet</fr> or the one called <fr>chaple</fr> or with a
small file. Above all, avoid touching your work, but touch only the burr
or lumpy parts that will have occurred during the casting. While
reworking, moisten and rub your work with a small <m>bristle</m>
brush.</ab>

         <head>Casting</head>

         <ab>

When you make a cast of delicate animals, like <al>snakes</al>, start by
casting the belly side, or the under-tail, for this side has straighter
lines which are easier to rework than the back side, which is more
veined and is more marked.</ab>

Remove burrs very carefully with the point of a chaple or a burin, then
scrape the burrs with the side of a burin, or carefully with a small
file, and rub with <m>willow coals</m> and small brushes. Continue,
also, with the lines not interrupted by burrs.</ab>

         <ab>

A lot of <sup>
               <m>silver</m>
            </sup> is wasted because of the <m>lead</m>
which is mixed with it, as occurs in cupellation, and makes it leap in
small bits onto the edges of the crucible and onto the <m>charcoal</m>
which covers it and is also gross. And by this means, it is good to melt
<m>silver coins</m>, like reals and others, and make them into ingots
prior to casting <al>lizards</al> or <al>animals</al>, for it comes out
better. I cleanly molded a small, <m>silver</m> 
            <al>viper</al>, like in
the first <sup>recipe above</sup>. And at the end of the line of 4

         <head>Blowing</head>

         <ab>

When you smelt <m>silver</m> and <m>gold</m> do not blow too hard or
with force, because the <m>charcoal</m> will become spent and the
crucible will sink and, potentially, spill over. But when your mold is
ready, blow strongly in order to properly heat the <m>silver</m> or
<m>gold</m>. When all are melted it is necessary to blow over the top
with a small bellows, doing the same for <m>gold</m>, for it removes and
reduces the smoke.</ab>

         <head>Molds</head>

         <ab>

For molds wherein something must be burned (away), and do not open
before being reheated: do not cast before refiring/reheating. For large
molds that produce large and wide casts, it is necessary to score it
with strong notches so that the <m>pitch</m> of the metal does not run
as forcefully. These will not make many burrs if they are pressed. Prior
to doing so, place between the mold and the press pieces of thick
<m>felt for mittens</m>, which will fill the cavities and protect the
mold from cracking. The clamps should be placed prior to heating or
drying.</ab>

         <ab>

            <margin>left-top</margin>

When the ground from which you are making your earthen base to lay out
your <m>animal</m> is too soft, the pins you place come out easily when
you cast the sand and so the mold is spoilt and the design is defeated.
Therefore when you know that your slab is too tender and soft, spread
some hot cinders over it and blow with the bellows.</ab>

         <ab>

If you don't add enough <m>alum de plume</m> or <m>crocus</m> 
            <sup>your
mold</sup> will easily crack when heated. But if your <sup>sand</sup> is
mixed as it ought to be, <sup>the mold</sup> will sustain itself. You'll
know it's of good quality when, while still hot after casting, it
immoderately soaks up the <m>water</m> when dipped and breaks easily,
because the <m>alum</m> and the <m>crocus</m> render it spongy. To the
contrary, bad sand, which is composed of <m>plaster</m> and <m>brick</m>
and is not well mixed with <m>alum</m>, breaks easily in fire and
hardens in <m>water</m>. If possible, cast all at once.</ab>

         <head>Molds</head>

         <ab>

When you cast <m>lead</m>, your molds must be very dry, even if the
molds are large. The outside of the molds must be reddened, and it is
necessary to keep them in continuous heat until they do not smoke
anymore inside. Do not reheat your molds several times, but continue
when you have begun and do not let them cool in the cold because they
will crack. Let them cool near the fire. When your molds are still as
warm as above, remark, you can put your finger into the casting gate
without burning your skin. If your mold is large, it takes more time to
cure and to dry, and you must also cast warmer.</ab>

If anything has been omitted: the harvester is not blamed for leaving
some corn ears.

If some craftsmen complain that their craft secrets are being
discovered, as the goddesses of Eleusis complained to N. the Pythagorean
that their mysteries were disclosed, excuse yourself in the words of the
ancient Hebrews quoted by Josephus.</ab>

         <ab>

As a hen will carefully search the rubbish thrown out of a house for a
crumb or a seed to distribute to her chicks, so will the orphans receive
whatever has been discovered in those arts that are considered vile and
despicable.</ab>

         <ab>

Tablet of Cebes: idle. But The Workshop represents all things active.
</ab>

         <ab>

If the jealous will disapprove picking up these things and taking them
from others, reply that since Nullum est jam dictum quod non dictum aut
factum sit prius and it is commonly believed that all arts were invented
within a thousand years, do not imagine you could invent anything new
but rather rediscover the long-buried, unknown and forgotten books of
Numa in order to reveal them to those who are ignorant of them; and
that, just as the day before teaches the day after, you also needed to
learn from those before you in order to teach those after you. The
Latins learnt from the Greeks, as Cicero did from Plato and Virgil from
Homer (Aulus Gellius). Valerius Maximus only reawakened various authors
who had written previously, and Livy's 23rd book <x>revived</x> the 2nd
or 3rd book of Polybius. Among the Egyptians, Serapis was deemed the
inventor of agriculture, but among the Sicilians, it was Ceres.
Pythagoras and others from Tyana learnt during their travels those
disciplines which, back in their countries, they claimed to have
invented. Does one not call a weaver the maker of his precious cloth or
fabric, even though he did not himself dye and twine <x>the yarn</x> nor
wind and prepare the reels and balls of thread? Is a mason not the
builder of the house, for picking up ready-made stones? Apollo a Chirone
medicari didicit &amp; tamen deus medicinae habitus. Homerus Orphei
poema imitatus est, nam cum Orpheus sic prius exorsus esset, 'Iram cane
dea Cereris frugiferentis', ita reddit Homerus, 'Iram cane dea Pelidae
Achillis'. In Justin Martyr, towards the beginning.

The ones weighing about 27 lb. are ix pousses long and the mouth is 6
<x>pousses</x> in diameter. At their bottom, they are 6 lignes thick,
and 3 for the mouth. The ones weighing 17 lb are 8 poulsses long and the
mouth is five <x>poulsses</x>. They are all covered together, all the
forks, rods, and tools which one uses, with a big canvas or big cloth so
that they do not make any noise. It is good that they sit loaded for a
while. After the <m>powder</m> has been put in, it is grinded very hard
and then tightly pressed <m>paper</m> is put in, then a cake of well
pressed <m>wax</m> and, on the <m>wax</m>, another slab of <m>cork</m>
that fits in very snugly and that you have to force in. In this way, the
<m>powder</m> remains well packed and gives much greater force, and if
you wish, you can put on the <m>cork</m> slab one of wood pierced in the
middle, if the mortar has a pierced bottom, which is believed to be the
easiest and which makes a greater hole because it cannot recoil. And for
these that have a pierced bottom, one must have a good gimlet to first
make the hole so that the rod, which is made by the point of the gimlet,
has before and without noise attached the mortar. And for these, one
must cover the button, which is quite sharply filed, with <m>waxed
canvas</m>, or add <m>wax</m> to it so that it completely plugs the hole
in the bottom. But because the doors are sometimes iron and the iron
rods cannot pierce it, an iron fork made like pincers and another iron
stick made with three claws, like you see painted, are use. And in this
way, the mortar stays in place well and is immediately steadied. The

         <ab>rod that we put into the touch-hole, and then, with a rope wrapped
around the end of a baston, we ignite it and promptly retreat to take
cover. The small mortars of 16 or 17 lb. are attached promptly with a
short, hooked rod made like a wimble, and if it is of a good alloy, we
can ignite it by hand. It is done in this way for mortars of 27 lb., but
then we only put three lb. of powder. The door really needs to be strong
so as not to be blown off for seventeenth lb. mortars. Some people use
little bells worn by oxen or mules as an door for the mortars. Others
load two canons of guns and, with a gimlet and a string, tie them with
the opening against the door. If the mortars are good and do not
explode, they only recoil and cannot harm if one is next to them.</ab>

         <ab>A is a small rod, hooked like the hinge of a door and made as a

         <ab>C is a common mortar of 27 or 30 lb. pierced at the bottom, where a

on the tip so as to quickly hang the mortar against a door that will not
be covered with <m>iron</m> plates.</ab>

the height or width of the door.</ab>

         <ab>F is another <m>iron</m> fork of the same height that supports the
fork made as pincers and also sustains the mortar, and with its low claw
prevents the pincers from recoiling.</ab>

         <head>Reducing a round form into a hollow one</head>

         <ab>You must firstly mold it with <m>plaster</m> as has been said
before, and in the <m>plaster</m> throw in some <m>wax</m> from which
will come a relief that you will repair very neatly, and will shape at
your pleasure. Then you will mold this <m>wax</m> relief once more in
<m>plaster</m>, or even better with your tempered sand,
<figure>#</figure>, as if for a noyau. And in the latter throw in some
<m>lead</m> and from this you will have a very neat relief, and if it is
not, repair it on <m>cement</m> or a similar material, and beware that
it should always release well. And this one will always serve you as a
model for making as many hollow molds as you would like. In this way,
place half of your <m>lead</m> figure which you have <m>oiled</m>, and
moisten it with <m>spirits</m> as we have seen above, on your
<m>clay</m> base, then mold this half with a <m>white plaster</m>.
Having taken hold, and having smoothed and flattened the <m>plaster</m>,
take your <m>black wax</m> mixed with <m>sulphur</m> as we have seen
before, because it leaves nothing in the mold and melts quicker. Dip it
in hot <m>urine</m>, and once it is softened enough, make an imprint
with it on your half figure in <m>lead</m>. And you will have a very
neat hollow mold. Then adapt your <m>wax</m> hollow mold into a square
shape, as it pleases you, as long as you have sufficient thickness, and
make sure it is well even on all sides, and then mold this hollow
<m>wax</m>; and having it imprinted on one side, and having it flat and
even on the other, in the same way that you would mold a flat medal in
<m>wax</m> or <m>metal</m> in a noyau. And the noyau mold will give you,
whether in <m>silver</m> or any other metal you wish, a figure similar
to the <m>wax</m> one, which is to say, flat and even on one side, and
hollow on the other. And having cleaned this hollow, and having put it
in the <m>bleach</m>, if it is made of <m>silver</m>, you can put into
it some <m>sugar</m> work</ab>

         <ab>You have to leave them cool down rather than blow inside to clean
them, because they hold the ashes when they are hot. Once cooled, they
are easier to clean. Have a fine <m>brass</m> wire or a thin straw to
thoroughly clean the tail because it is through it that you cast. Blow
into it and siphon, bringing it to you. Give it volume before casting
the tail with <m>wax</m>, then cut it.
