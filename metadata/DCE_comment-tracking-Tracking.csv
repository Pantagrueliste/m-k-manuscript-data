The branch of the “Seigneurs de Planèzes” includes a “François Ducros de Bérail”, Baron of Belcastel and Guitalens, who died in 1600. The castle of Planèzes, which gives its name to this branch, is located in Luc-la-Primaube, in Aveyron. In 1577, in the context of the religious wars, this François Ducros led twenty men on horseback to Toulouse for the king’s service and the city’s defense, on the orders of François de La Valette de Cornusson, Governor of the Rouergue and Sénéchal of Toulouse. In 1598, he bought the land of Lestang, also in Aveyron, from the widow of La Vallette. The son of François Ducros, also named François, was Seigneur of Guitalens. A member of this family, Guyot Ducros de Planèzes, was a Chevalier of the Order of Malta in 1571. This may indicate a connection to the entry on the Order of Malta’s Commanders’ Cross (f. 40v). No other “François Ducros” has been recorded in Toulouse. Another branch of the Ducros, the “de Villenouvelle” branch, includes several merchants, but none of them was named François. The Archives départementales de Haute-Garonne keep a “Livre de raison” dedicated to the Delpech and Ducros families, merchants of Toulouse, dating from 1539-1564 (ADHG, 3E12059). It discusses the affairs of Antoine Du Cros, nephew and partner of Pierre Assézat, one of the most powerful pastel merchants in Toulouse, famous for having built the Hôtel d’Assézat.

Among its members, Rigail Ouvrier was Capitoul in 1541 and 1544. Then, several members were Conseillers in the Parliament, such as Jean Ouvrier (d. 1580) who was one of Rigail’s sons. Jean’s son, also called Jean Ouvrier, was also Conseiller in the Parliament. He was a strong supporter of the League and died in 1592 at the Battle of Villemur alongside his friend Duke Scipion de Joyeuse and the Sieur de Pardeilhan, commander of the artillery. Benoît Ouvrier, another son of Rigail, was a merchant and died in 1573. His house was located on the “rue des Fleurs,” near the Mint. This is probably the ""feu sr Ouvryer"" mentioned in the manuscript. Benoît's sons also had important roles. Among them, Gabriel d’Ouvrier was Capitoul in 1610-1611, and François d’Ouvrier was <i>Maître des ports et passages</i> in 1608. The Ouvrier family was linked to the Du Cros family, whose name is also mentioned in the manuscript on fol. 9v in the entry <i>Brouillart</i>, through two marriages, one between Jean Ouvrier (the supporter of the League) and Anne Du Cros in 1586, and the other between Gabriel Ouvrier (his brother) and Françoise Du Cros in 1592.","tc, tcn, tl",,Historical ,,
